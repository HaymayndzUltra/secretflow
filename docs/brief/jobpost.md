Description:
I’m building an early-stage startup in the [dating/wellbeing/social] space with an ambitious launch timeline. I’m looking for a strong backend engineer who can work with me on building the MVP and scaling it into a full product.

This role will start as a contract/freelance engagement on Upwork, but I’m seeking someone who’s open to a long-term partnership if there’s a strong fit. Down the line, this could evolve into a leadership role within the company.

What I’m Looking For:

– Deep expertise in Python backend development (FastAPI, Django, or Flask)
– Solid knowledge of databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or similar)
– Experience deploying secure and scalable APIs
– Familiarity with cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) and DevOps is a big plus
– Any AI/ML background (recommendation systems, NLP, matching algorithms, data pipelines) is a bonus
– Entrepreneurial mindset: comfortable with rapid iteration, ambiguity, and startup pace

Initial Scope (Upwork contract):
– Architect and implement the backend for the MVP
– Build and deploy core APIs and integrate with the mobile frontend
– Ensure performance, scalability, and security from day one
– Collaborate closely on product decisions and technical strategy
