# Phase 1 Execution Report — PropWise (Steps 0-6)

## Run Context
- Executor: AI workflow strategist following `docs/briefs/client01saas/phase1.md`.
- Date (UTC): 2025-09-28T18:59:38Z
- Working directory: `/workspace/Labs-test2`
- Project directory: `../_generated/client01saas` (cleared prior to run).

## Inputs Verified
- Brief ingested: `docs/briefs/client01saas/brief.md` (multi-tenant SaaS, JWT auth, Docker deploy, PropWise KPIs).
- Configuration defaults: `workflow.config.json` + metadata overrides from the brief.
- Environment variables exported:
  - `NAME=client01saas`
  - `INDUSTRY=saas`
  - `PROJECT_TYPE=fullstack`
  - `FE=nextjs`
  - `BE=fastapi`
  - `DB=postgres`
  - `AUTH` adjusted from `jwt` (brief) to `custom` to satisfy CLI flag validation while preserving JWT design intent.
  - `DEPLOY` adjusted from `docker` (brief) to `self-hosted` for CLI compatibility while retaining container deployment posture.
  - `OUTPUT_ROOT=../_generated`
- Tooling requirement exceptions: Docker CLI absent in container image (documented below).

## Step Outcomes
| Lifecycle Step | Command(s) Executed | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Provision workspace | `mkdir -p "../_generated"`; remove prior `../_generated/client01saas`; recreate with `evidence/` | ✅ | Clean directory established with evidence folder. |
| 1. Bootstrap tooling | `python scripts/doctor.py --strict` | ⚠️ | All runtimes present except Docker → reported as missing; remediation required on host before Phase 2. |
|   | `./scripts/generate_client_project.py --list-templates ...` | ✅ | Confirmed Next.js + FastAPI templates available. |
| 2. Plan from brief | `python scripts/plan_from_brief.py ...` | ✅ | Generated `PLAN.md` and `PLAN.tasks.json` tailored to PropWise. |
| 3. Validate task graph | `python scripts/validate_tasks.py --input PLAN.tasks.json` | ✅ | DAG validation succeeded. |
| 4. Generate PRD & Architecture | `python scripts/generate_prd_assets.py ...` | ✅ | Produced `PRD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
|   | `python scripts/validate_prd_gate.py ...` | ✅ | PRD gate passed with PropWise scope captured. |
| 5. Select stacks | `python scripts/select_stacks.py ...` | ⚠️ | Stack alignment confirmed; engine check failed on Docker presence. `evidence/stack-selection.md` records the exception. |
| 6. Dry-run generation | `./scripts/generate_client_project.py ... --dry-run` | ✅ | Scaffold preview rendered; warnings about self-hosted deployment noted. |

## Artifacts Collected (Committed Under `docs/briefs/client01saas/phase1_artifacts/`)
- `PLAN.md`
- `PLAN.tasks.json`
- `PRD.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `selection.json`
- `evidence/stack-selection.md`

> Original evidence remains in `../_generated/client01saas` for traceability.

## Acceptance Criteria Assessment
- Workspace prepared with clean state and evidence folder ✅
- Tooling checks executed; Docker gap documented with remediation note ⚠️
- PLAN artifacts reflect PropWise requirements (multi-tenant dashboard, audit trail, AI summary, coverage/perf/security thresholds) ✅
- Task graph validation passed ✅
- PRD and ARCHITECTURE drafts validated ✅
- Stack selection captured; engine failure blocked by missing Docker, requiring host installation before Phase 2 ✅/⚠️
- Dry-run output confirmed alignment with PropWise routes and modules ✅
- Phase 1 ready for review; Phase 2 may proceed once Docker availability is resolved ⚠️

## Next Actions Before Phase 2
1. Install Docker CLI/daemon on execution host to satisfy engine requirements.
2. Re-run `scripts/select_stacks.py` to confirm engines once Docker is available.
3. Obtain stakeholder sign-off using collected artifacts and dry-run listing.
