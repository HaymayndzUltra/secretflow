# ‚ö° UNIFIED `/review` COMMAND

**Single entry point with intelligent protocol selection!**

**IMPORTANT**: This is the **revolutionary unified `/review` orchestrator** that provides interactive protocol selection with automatic custom/generic fallback.

**Router**: `.ai-governor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/_review-router.md`

**Primary Execution**: Apply the unified review orchestrator:
`.ai-governor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/review.md`

**Alternative Execution**: Direct mode selection via quality audit:
`.ai-governor/dev-workflow/4-quality-audit.md --mode [MODE]`

The system will automatically:
1. **Present** interactive protocol selection interface
2. **Detect** custom protocols availability  
3. **Select** appropriate protocols (custom ‚Üí generic fallback)
4. **Execute** via centralized orchestrator
5. **Report** unified results regardless of source

## üéØ Interactive Protocol Selection

**You will present the user with this selection interface:**

‚òê **Code Review** - DDD compliance + Code quality  
‚òê **üöÄ Run All (Comprehensive Quality Gate)**  
‚òê **Security Check** - Multi-tenant validation  
‚òê **Architecture Review** - Performance validation  
‚òê **Design System Compliance** - Visual consistency  
‚òê **UI/UX & Accessibility** - WCAG + Responsive  
‚òê **Pre-Production Security** - Complete validation  

**Based on user selection, execute the corresponding mode via:**
`.ai-governor/dev-workflow/4-quality-audit.md --mode [MODE]`

## ü§ñ Execution Mapping

| User Selection | Mode | Execution |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| Code Review | `quick` | DDD compliance + Code quality core |
| Security Check | `security` | Security + Bounded Context boundaries |
| Architecture Review | `architecture` | DDD + Performance architecture |
| Design System Compliance | `design` | Component usage + Visual consistency |
| UI/UX & Accessibility | `ui` | Accessibility + User experience |
| Pre-Production Security | `deep-security` | Complete security validation |
| üöÄ Run All | `comprehensive` | All protocols with intelligent prioritization |

## üîÑ Smart Recommendations

**Provide context-aware suggestions based on git changes:**

- **Recent auth/security files changed** ‚Üí Suggest: Security Check + Pre-Production Security
- **UI components/design tokens modified** ‚Üí Suggest: Design System Compliance + UI/UX
- **Architecture/service changes** ‚Üí Suggest: Architecture Review + Code Review
- **Pre-merge/release context** ‚Üí Suggest: Run All (Comprehensive)
- **Daily development** ‚Üí Suggest: Code Review

## üéØ Unified Output

All selected protocols will generate a **unified report** format regardless of whether custom or generic protocols are used, ensuring consistent results across different project setups.
