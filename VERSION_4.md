# AI Governor End-to-End Automation Blueprint

## Current System Highlights
- **In-repo governance knowledge base** ensuring contextual rules and architectural READMEs remain versioned with code, enabling predictable AI collaboration.【F:README.md†L1-L58】
- **Five-protocol operator workflow** that guides AI roles from project bootstrap to implementation and post-task audits, leveraging unified quality gates.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L1-L120】
- **Unified review orchestration** with intelligent fallback, context-aware recommendations, and cross-tool prompts for deep audits.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L1-L159】【F:.cursor/prompts/README.md†L1-L190】
- **Layered rule hierarchy** codifying foundational, shared, and project-specific constraints to safely grant AI autonomy.【F:.cursor/rules/README.md†L1-L68】
- **Workflow templates and lifecycle playbooks** mapping evidence, automation scripts, and phase assets from planning through operations.【F:workflow/README.md†L1-L40】【F:workflow1/README.md†L1-L73】
- **Project generator and template packs** that transform briefs into full-stack scaffolds, governed by compatibility validation and curated stacks.【F:project_generator/README.md†L1-L86】【F:template-packs/README.md†L1-L40】
- **Operational tooling catalog** covering planning, generation, quality gates, evidence logging, deployment, and health checks for automation lanes.【F:scripts/README.md†L1-L117】

## Human-Validated Autonomous Delivery Plan

### Phase 0 — Repository Readiness & Rule Synchronization
- **Objective:** Ensure the automation environment mirrors the governance baseline before client intake.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Run rule audits and normalization scripts to confirm master/common/project rule integrity.【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L63】
  - Sync workflow templates and evidence schemas into the working branch for reference.【F:workflow/README.md†L1-L40】
- **Artifacts:** Rule audit reports, updated context kit manifest, evidence schema confirmation log.
- **Human Validation:** Confirm no blocking rule gaps and approve rule manifest snapshot before continuing.

### Phase 1 — Discovery Intake & PRD Approval
- **Objective:** Convert client brief + call transcripts into a validated PRD.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Ingest brief using generator parsers, enrich with industry defaults, and draft PRD per Protocol 1.【F:project_generator/README.md†L18-L28】【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L28-L39】
  - Assemble supporting assets (charter, context kit) from workflow playbook templates.【F:workflow1/README.md†L16-L24】
- **Artifacts:** Draft PRD, charter summary, context kit updates.
- **Human Validation:** Verify PRD scope, assumptions, and success metrics match client expectations before freezing requirements.

### Phase 2 — Technical Planning & Architecture Baseline
- **Objective:** Translate the PRD into detailed tasks, architecture decisions, and compliance-ready evidence.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Generate task list using Protocol 2, then produce PLAN.md and tasks.json with lifecycle scripts.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L40-L65】【F:scripts/README.md†L42-L51】
  - Populate architecture and contract packs via Phase 2 templates and scripts, updating manifests per schema.【F:workflow1/README.md†L20-L37】【F:workflow/README.md†L24-L35】【F:workflow1/codex-phase2-design/templates/OpenAPI/README.md†L1-L27】
- **Artifacts:** Approved PLAN.md, tasks.json, architecture pack, updated evidence manifest, API contracts.
- **Human Validation:** Review architecture diagrams/ADRs, ensure backlog aligns with milestones, and sign off on compliance coverage before build generation.

### Phase 3 — Project Generation & Environment Provisioning
- **Objective:** Scaffold the project repository with governed templates and DevEx assets.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Execute project generator with validated stack selections, pulling template packs and policy DSL as required.【F:project_generator/README.md†L18-L61】【F:template-packs/README.md†L1-L35】
  - Enforce template hygiene (no installs, clean dependencies) and document stack metadata in workflow evidence.【F:template-packs/README-NO-INSTALL.md†L1-L17】【F:workflow/README.md†L16-L22】
- **Artifacts:** Generated repo scaffold, stack manifest, initial evidence entries for generation run.
- **Human Validation:** Confirm scaffold matches desired stack, security baselines, and environment setup expectations prior to implementation.

### Phase 4 — Implementation Sprints with Integrated Quality Gates
- **Objective:** Complete parent tasks while enforcing continuous quality and compliance checks.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Follow Protocol 3 to implement tasks in sequenced sessions, invoking unified review orchestrator per parent task.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L52-L120】
  - Use `/review` router, context analyzer, and prompts for quick, security, architecture, and accessibility audits as work proceeds.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L19-L102】【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/utils/README.md†L1-L33】【F:.cursor/prompts/README.md†L1-L190】
  - Log test, coverage, and dependency metrics via high-priority scripts, updating evidence manifests.【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L63】
- **Artifacts:** Code changes with inline validation notes, audit reports per mode, updated run logs, metric JSONs.
- **Human Validation:** Review summarized audit outcomes and approve each parent task when quality gates pass and evidence is complete.

### Phase 5 — System Integration & Quality Rails Hardening
- **Objective:** Validate cross-service integration, observability, and release-readiness controls.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Execute workflow1 Phase 3 & 4 scripts for quality rails and integration artifacts (feature flags, observability packs, smoke tests).【F:workflow1/README.md†L27-L38】
  - Aggregate coverage/perf/dependency metrics and enforce gates with orchestration CLI.【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L63】
- **Artifacts:** Updated evidence for security/accessibility plans, observability specs, staging smoke logs, gate pass reports.
- **Human Validation:** Approve readiness checklist ensuring non-functional requirements and integration outcomes meet contract before launch prep.

### Phase 6 — Launch Orchestration & Submission Packaging
- **Objective:** Deploy to target environments and assemble client-ready deliverables.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Run Phase 5 launch scripts for deployment rehearsals, DR drills, and manifest logging.【F:workflow1/README.md†L39-L42】
  - Use workflow automation to execute deployment helpers and build submission packs aligned with workflow templates.【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L117】【F:workflow/README.md†L7-L22】
- **Artifacts:** Deployment run logs, DR rehearsal evidence, submission checklist, packaged deliverable bundle.
- **Human Validation:** Confirm production readiness, verify submission pack completeness, and authorize client delivery.

### Phase 7 — Operations & Continuous Improvement
- **Objective:** Maintain SLAs, capture learnings, and keep compliance assets current post-launch.
- **AI Actions:**
  - Schedule retrospectives, monitor SLOs, and log dependency/security updates via Phase 6 operations scripts.【F:workflow1/README.md†L43-L46】
  - Trigger periodic workflow automation checks (doctor, scan_deps, evidence_report) to maintain health.【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L117】
- **Artifacts:** Operations dashboards, SLO reports, retro notes, dependency audit logs.
- **Human Validation:** Review operational summaries, confirm SLA adherence, and prioritize backlog adjustments before next iteration.
