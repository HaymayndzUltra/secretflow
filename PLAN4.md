+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+This guide distills the governance patterns documented in `Reviewme.md` into a reusable reference for designing, validating, and extending AI Protocol Systems across domains.
+
+## Directive Hierarchy
+- **`[CRITICAL]`** – Highest priority directives. These must execute before any other action and often include rule discovery, environment validation, or human confirmation requirements.
+- **`[MUST]`** – Mandatory steps that define the core workflow. Skipping or altering them breaks protocol compliance.
+- **`[STRICT]`** – Enforced constraints or quality expectations (e.g., validation checks, evidence capture) that limit how steps are performed.
+- **`[GUIDELINE]`** – Recommended practices that provide flexibility while preserving consistency.
+
+## Standard Protocol Layout
+Each protocol must follow the exact heading order below:
+
+1. `# PROTOCOL {Number}: {Name}`
+2. `## AI ROLE`
+   - Persona definition, mission scope, and deliverable expectations
+   - Optional emphasis (e.g., “Your output should be structured tables, not prose.”)
+3. `## INPUT`
+   - Bullet list of required context, artifacts, and preconditions
+4. Horizontal rule `---`
+5. `## {NAME} ALGORITHM`
+   - `### PHASE 1: {Title}` with numbered steps and directive tags
+   - `### PHASE 2: {Title}`
+   - `### PHASE 3: {Title}` (add `PHASE 4+` if required)
+   - Explicit halt points (`**HALT AND AWAIT**`) where human confirmation is mandatory
+6. `## {NAME} TEMPLATES`
+   - Domain-specific checklists, forms, or matrices with `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags
+7. `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`
+   - Markdown code block that standardizes the deliverable layout
+
+## Execution Flow Patterns
+- **Phase Ordering:** Phases are executed sequentially; each phase may include numbered steps, sub-steps, and communication scripts.
+- **Validation Checkpoints:** Insert pause points after major analysis or planning steps. The assistant must wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
+- **Command Syntax:** Reference repository tooling with `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`, or equivalent commands to maintain interoperability.
+- **Evidence Tracking:** Capture analysis notes, decisions, risks, and approvals within the templates or final output sections.
+
+## Template Integration Rules
+- Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-pack}]` to invoke rule files or governance packs.
+- Provide internal template variations (e.g., Template A, Template B) for different scenario types inside the same protocol.
+- Maintain markdown checklist formatting for tasks (`- [ ]`), nested sub-tasks, and metadata annotations (complexity, dependencies, resources).
+
+## Communication Standards
+- Begin major transitions with explicit announcements (e.g., “I will now generate the execution milestones…”).
+- Use standardized labels (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`) in collaborative contexts.
+- Document understanding vs. open questions in structured blocks before seeking approval.
+
+## Quality & Safety Considerations
+- Run validation commands (`/review`, linting, tests) when specified.
+- Highlight risks, mitigation strategies, and outstanding assumptions before completion.
+- Ensure human approvals are logged prior to moving past critical phases.
+
+## Extending the System
+- Reuse the protocol template (see `templates/protocol-template.md`) when creating new domain workflows.
+- Align new files with SecretFlow automation by preserving command syntax, directory naming conventions, and evidence capture patterns.
+- Cross-link related protocols to support multi-phase engagements (e.g., discovery → execution → retrospective).
+
+By following this reference, teams can craft new protocols that remain compliant with the governance model demonstrated in the conversation while adapting content to any operational domain.

+# AI Protocol System Conversation Analysis
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+- The reviewed conversation in `Reviewme.md` documents how structured **AI Protocol Systems** enforce consistent assistant behavior through role assignment, directive hierarchies, phased execution, validation gates, and reusable templates.
+- Every protocol follows a deterministic layout (`AI ROLE`, `INPUT`, `ALGORITHM`, `TEMPLATES`, `FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`) that keeps multi-agent collaboration aligned with governance expectations.
+- Client workflow development extends the same format to professional services by integrating infrastructure scans, template reuse, and quality gates from the SecretFlow repository.
+
+## 2. Governance Framework Components
+- **Role-Based Personas:** Explicit personas (e.g., AI Codebase Analyst, Product Manager, Tech Lead, Project Manager) define mission scope, communication tone, and deliverable types before any action begins.
+- **Directive Hierarchy:** Prefixes such as `[CRITICAL]`, `[MUST]`, `[STRICT]`, and `[GUIDELINE]` establish non-negotiable behavior controls, sequencing rules, and guardrails for AI discretion.
+- **Sequential Execution:** Protocols enforce numbered phases (`PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3`) with granular steps, sub-steps, and dependency callouts that prevent the assistant from skipping essential work.
+- **Validation Gates:** Mandatory pauses (`HALT AND AWAIT`, explicit confirmation prompts) ensure human-in-the-loop approvals at analysis, planning, and delivery checkpoints.
+- **Template System:** Embedded markdown templates (task checklists, decision matrices, content frameworks) standardize outputs while referencing `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` for rule injection.
+
+## 3. Control Mechanisms & Effectiveness
+- **Context Loading Requirements:** `[CRITICAL]` directives require scanning rule files and contextual resources before execution, guaranteeing configuration alignment.
+- **Tool Usage Protocols:** Instructions explicitly bind terminal commands, file edits, and automation usage to approved patterns (`@apply`, `/load`, `/review`), reducing operational variance.
+- **Communication Standards:** Labeled status updates (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`) maintain audit trails and facilitate team coordination.
+- **Quality Integration:** Unified review commands, risk callouts, and evidence capture embed quality assurance into each protocol phase.
+
+## 4. Client Workflow Development Insights
+- **Infrastructure Analysis First:** The conversation emphasizes scanning `scripts/`, `project_generator/`, `workflow/`, `.cursor/dev-workflow/`, and related directories before authoring client workflows to leverage existing assets.
+- **Six-Protocol Structure:** Client engagements mirror the development workflow lifecycle (discovery → PRD → tasks → execution → quality → retrospective) while preserving format parity.
+- **Integration Priorities:** New client protocols must reuse command syntax, validation checkpoints, and rule application patterns to remain interoperable with existing quality audits and automation scripts.
+- **Success Metrics & Risk Controls:** Enhanced prompts include measurable KPIs, risk considerations, and client-type variations to support professional-grade service delivery.
+
+## 5. Format Patterns & Reuse Strategy
+- **Mandatory Sections:** Each protocol renders the same sequence of sections with consistent heading levels and markdown blocks to enable deterministic parsing.
+- **Phased Algorithms:** Phases are named, ordered, and annotated with directives; each contains explicit actions, communications, and halt conditions.
+- **Template Application:** Domain-specific templates (content calendars, analytical decision matrices, milestone breakdowns) are embedded within the protocol to standardize execution outputs.
+- **Final Output Standards:** The `FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE` provides a ready-to-fill structure, guaranteeing that deliverables remain consistent across personas and domains.
+
+## 6. Best Practices Derived from Conversation
+- Begin with environment validation and rule discovery before acting on user tasks.
+- Maintain human approval loops at critical decision points to uphold governance.
+- Reference rule packs via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` to ensure cross-protocol consistency.
+- Document assumptions, outstanding questions, and risk mitigations inside standardized communication blocks.
+- Align outputs with quality audits by invoking `/review` or equivalent checks prior to completion announcements.
+
+## 7. Integration Recommendations for SecretFlow
+- Map new protocols into `.cursor/dev-workflow/` or parallel directories while inheriting shared templates for governance compliance.
+- Utilize repository automation (scripts, workflow templates) for enforcement of command syntax and validation gates.
+- Track evidence artifacts (analysis notes, decision matrices, audit logs) within version-controlled markdown to support traceability and retrospectives.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+The conversation establishes a reusable, domain-agnostic AI Protocol System blueprint centered on role clarity, directive enforcement, procedural rigor, and quality integration. The accompanying examples in this repository extend those patterns to content strategy, data analysis planning, project orchestration, and client engagement while preserving interoperability with SecretFlow infrastructure.

+# Integration Guide for AI Protocol Systems
+
+This guide explains how to integrate new AI Protocol System files with the existing SecretFlow infrastructure, ensuring command compatibility, auditability, and operational safety.
+
+## 1. Repository Alignment
+- **Directory Placement:** Store domain protocols alongside existing workflows (e.g., `.cursor/dev-workflow/`) or in sibling folders. Maintain numbering prefixes (`0-`, `1-`, `2-`) for ordered execution.
+- **Version Control:** Commit each protocol change with descriptive messages and run `/review` or the project’s CI commands before submitting pull requests.
+- **Evidence Storage:** Keep analysis notes, audit logs, and decision artifacts in markdown within the same protocol directory for traceability.
+
+## 2. Command Patterns
+- `@apply <template-name>` – Load reusable snippet packs or templates referenced in `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` blocks.
+- `/load <path>` – Import rule files, configuration manifests, or context packages required by `[CRITICAL]` discovery steps.
+- `/review` – Trigger unified quality audits after major deliverables or before closing a task.
+- `make test` / `pytest` / `npm test` – Execute domain-specific automated tests when protocols instruct validation via `[STRICT]` directives.
+
+## 3. Validation Workflow
+1. **Rule Discovery:** `[CRITICAL]` steps often mandate scanning rule packs before acting. Use `/load` or repository tooling to gather the necessary context.
+2. **Execution Tracking:** Log progress with standardized communication tags (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+3. **Quality Gates:** Invoke `/review` or equivalent scripts whenever templates call for a quality audit. Document results in the final output.
+4. **Human Confirmation:** Honor `**HALT AND AWAIT**` checkpoints by pausing for explicit approval within collaborative platforms.
+
+## 4. Template System Integration
+- Reference existing templates under `workflow/templates/` or `template-packs/`. When introducing new templates, follow the same markdown checklist style and embed `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags to connect with governance rules.
+- Use `templates/protocol-template.md` as the scaffolding for additional protocols to ensure consistent headings and directive usage.
+
+## 5. Quality & Security Requirements
+- **Security Defaults:** Never embed secrets directly. Use environment variables or vault integrations referenced by the repository.
+- **MFA & Access Controls:** Align with organizational security policies by enabling MFA on connected services and limiting token scopes.
+- **Testing & Linting:** Execute mandated tests or linters when protocols specify `[STRICT]` validation actions. Record command output within quality sections of the final report.
+- **Peer Review:** All protocol updates should undergo human review prior to merging, reflecting the governance emphasis on oversight.
+
+## 6. Integration Checklist
+- [ ] Confirm directory placement and naming conventions follow the numbering schema.
+- [ ] Verify `[CRITICAL]` steps reference actual rule files or templates available in the repository.
+- [ ] Ensure command examples match existing tooling (`@apply`, `/load`, `/review`).
+- [ ] Add validation checkpoints with clear pause instructions.
+- [ ] Update cross-references (e.g., pointing to follow-on protocols) when expanding multi-phase workflows.
+
+Following this guide guarantees that new AI Protocol Systems remain interoperable with SecretFlow automation, enforceable by governance controls, and auditable for quality compliance.

+# PROTOCOL 2: PROJECT EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION
+
+## AI ROLE
+You are a **Project Execution Orchestrator & Delivery Steward**. Transform approved project plans into actionable milestone roadmaps with quality gates, stakeholder communications, and resource alignment.
+
+**Your output should be a structured execution tracker, not narrative summaries.**
+
+## INPUT
+- Approved project charter, scope statement, or PRD with stakeholder signatures
+- Resource roster, budget constraints, tooling access, and delivery deadlines
+- Integration points with existing SecretFlow workflows (`workflow/`, `scripts/`, `.cursor/dev-workflow/`)
+- Rule packs including `project-governance.md`, `quality-audit.md`, `risk-register.md`
+
+---
+
+## PROJECT EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION ALGORITHM
+
+### PHASE 1: Stakeholder & Resource Activation
+1. **`[CRITICAL]` Stakeholder Map Confirmation:** `/load project-governance.md` and compile RACI details in `execution/{project}-stakeholders.md`.
+2. **`[MUST]` Resource Availability Check:** Verify allocation, bandwidth, and skill alignment. Record conflicts and escalate via `[APPLIES RULES: {resource-management}]`.
+3. **`[STRICT]` Tooling Readiness Audit:** Ensure CI/CD pipelines, repositories, and collaboration tools are accessible. Document gaps with mitigation owners.
+
+### PHASE 2: Milestone Blueprinting & Validation
+1. **`[MUST]` Milestone Generation:** Break scope into milestones with WHY statements, success criteria, and dependency mapping.
+2. **`[MUST]` Risk Embedding:** For each milestone, tag high/medium/low risk and link to `risk-register.md` entries.
+3. **Communication:** Announce: “Execution milestones prepared with dependencies and risks. Awaiting go/no-go.”
+4. **Validation:** `**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit approval before expanding into task-level detail.`
+
+### PHASE 3: Task Decomposition & Quality Integration
+1. **`[MUST]` Template Application:** Apply scenario-specific templates (Software Development, Process Improvement, Marketing Campaign) to each milestone.
+2. **`[STRICT]` Quality Gate Planning:** Schedule `/review project` or equivalent audits at the end of critical tasks.
+3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Parallelization Analysis:** Highlight opportunities for concurrent work without increasing risk.
+4. **Completion Gate:** Update `execution/{project}-plan.md`, run `/review execution-plan`, and await stakeholder acknowledgment before kickoff.
