# Workflow1 Evidence Template Index

This catalog maps the legacy `workflow1` evidence templates into the unified automation workspace. Templates remain in their original
locations but are described here so automation and operator documentation can reference them consistently.

## Usage
- Reference this index when generating evidence manifests via the workflow1 automation wrappers.
- Each entry includes the phase, canonical destination within `workflow1/<phase>/evidence`, and a short description to help
  operators validate output.
- When migrating historical evidence, follow the [Migration Guide](../../../docs/operations/migration-guide.md) and validate conversions with the [Troubleshooting Guide](../../../docs/operations/troubleshooting.md).
