# AI Reports Evaluation - Narrative Summary

## Winner: VERSION_A (Score: 8.65/10)

VERSION_A is selected as the superior analysis based on overwhelming evidence quality and critical technical insights that other reports missed.

### Key Differentiators

**Critical Technical Discoveries (Unique to VERSION_A):**
- Identified fatal packaging flaw: `scripts/` lacks `__init__.py`, making all `from scripts.lifecycle_tasks` imports in INTEGRATION_PLAN.md:89 impossible without path manipulation
- Discovered sys.path hacks in `validate_compliance_assets.py:12-13` (`sys.path.insert(0, str(ROOT))`) that break when scripts are consumed as libraries in long-lived services
- Correctly noted timeline dependency inversion where Week 2 protocol updates require Week 3 templates

**Evidence Superiority:**
VERSION_A provides 24 precise file:line citations (【F:INTEGRATION_PLAN.md†L17-L52】), enabling complete verification. VERSION_C scores similarly high (8.55) with 26 citations and superior completeness, but misses the packaging failures. VERSION_B (4.80) and VERSION_D (5.50) provide vague or absent citations, making verification impossible.

**Technical Correctness:**
VERSION_A scores 9/10 by accurately describing code architecture: confirmed `scripts/workflow_automation/__init__.py` exists but parent `scripts/` is not a package; verified `project_generator/templates/registry.py` points to `template-packs/` creating duplication risk; validated `workflow1/codex-phase2-design/scripts/` contains automation that would be lost in markdown-only merges.

### Critical Risks Identified

1. **Import Failures (Immediate):** Current plan will fail at runtime due to non-package imports
2. **Template Divergence (High):** Registry fork between `project_generator` and unified workflow
3. **Protocol Automation Loss (High):** Flattening workflow1 protocols to markdown loses executable scripts
4. **Schedule Underestimation (Medium):** 5 weeks insufficient for 50+ script integration with packaging refactors

### Merge Recommendations

While VERSION_A is the clear winner, incorporate:
- **From C:** CLI compatibility layer strategy with telemetry-driven deprecation
- **From C:** External services integration (Git, AI governor, policy DSL) identification
- **From D:** Explicit artifact validation against `evidence/schema.json` checkpoint
- **From D:** Phase-specific testing gates rather than deferred Week 5 validation

### Implementation Readiness: PROCEED WITH MAJOR MODIFICATIONS

**Immediate Actions (Before Implementation):**
1. Make `scripts/` a proper Python package (add `__init__.py`)
2. Design unified TemplateRegistry shared by both systems
3. Catalog workflow1 automation assets for preservation
4. Resolve evidence schema conflicts with migration strategy
5. Resequence timeline to resolve dependency inversions

**Estimated Adjustment:** Add 2 weeks for packaging fixes and dependency resolution (7-week total vs. original 5-week plan).

**Next Steps:**
Execute the 8-step action plan from the evaluation, starting with comprehensive script inventory and packaging audit. All steps include citations to actual code, specific risk statements, and concrete mitigations tied to technical evidence.

---

**Conclusion:** VERSION_A demonstrates superior code-level analysis by identifying implementation blockers (non-package imports, sys.path manipulation) that would cause runtime failures. Combined with insights from VERSION_C (CLI strategy, external services) and VERSION_D (validation checkpoints, milestone testing), the merged recommendations provide a robust, evidence-based integration path.
