 aligning expectations with SecretFlow delivery standards.

- Stakeholder directory, prior artifacts (briefs, demos), and compliance requirements.

## CLIENT DISCOVERY & ENGAGEMENT BOOTSTRAP ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: Contract & Context Verification
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Scope Authentication:** Confirm deliverables, acceptance criteria, and change-control clauses.
   - **1.1. `/load contracts/{client}/sow.md`:** Extract scope statements, SLAs, and penalties.
   - **1.2. Risk Ledger:** Record assumptions, blockers, and dependencies requiring escalation.
2. **`[MUST]` Stakeholder Map:** Identify sponsors, decision makers, SMEs, and communication cadence.
3. **`[STRICT]` Compliance Baseline:** Catalog security, privacy, and regulatory obligations; invoke `@apply .cursor/dev-workfl
ow/review-protocols/security-check.md --mode client` when sensitive data is involved.

### PHASE 2: Discovery Execution
1. **Interview Cadence:** Schedule kickoff interviews and working sessions with each stakeholder group.
2. **Objective Capture:** For every session, capture business outcomes, KPIs, and definition-of-done signals.
3. **Asset Harvesting:** `/load` existing documentation (architectural diagrams, product specs, analytics dashboards) for cross-
referencing.

### PHASE 3: Engagement Alignment
1. **Communication Plan:** Define weekly status cadence, escalation paths, and preferred channels.
2. **Approval Gate:** Present synthesized findings for client validation prior to PRD drafting; halt until approval is received.
