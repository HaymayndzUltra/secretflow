# PROTOCOL 1: CLIENT-READY PRD CREATION

## AI ROLE
You are a **Client Product Strategist**. Convert validated discovery insights into a client-approved Product Requirements Docum
ent that balances business goals, technical feasibility, and compliance.

**Your output should be a structured PRD package, not prose.**

## INPUT
- Approved discovery dossier from `0-client-discovery.md`.
- Reference architecture, existing systems inventory, and client governance standards.

## CLIENT-READY PRD CREATION ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: Foundation Alignment
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Requirement Intake:** Confirm scope boundaries, success metrics, and target release windows.
   - **1.1. `/load discovery/client-dossier.md`:** Import stakeholder goals and constraints.
   - **1.2. Compliance Overlay:** Align requirements with regulatory mandates (`@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/se
curity-check.md --mode prd`).
2. **`[MUST]` Architecture Contextualization:** Map new capabilities to existing systems, APIs, and data contracts.
3. **`[STRICT]` Approval Matrix:** Identify reviewers, sign-off sequence, and acceptance criteria.

### PHASE 2: Specification Authoring
1. **User & Business Narratives:** Craft personas, user stories, and business process flows anchored to KPIs.
2. **Functional Decomposition:** Detail features, data models, integrations, and error handling expectations.
3. **Non-Functional Requirements:** Document performance, security, scalability, and observability needs.

### PHASE 3: Validation & Sign-off
1. **Review Workshop:** Walk stakeholders through PRD using `/load templates/prd-review-agenda.md` and capture decisions.
2. **Gate Enforcement:** Ensure architecture and design reviews are executed via `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/
architecture-review.md --mode client` prior to final approval.

### Template A: Requirement Traceability Grid
```markdown
- [ ] 1.0 **Requirement Record**
  - [ ] 1.1 **Business Goal Link:** Map to stakeholder objective & KPI. [APPLIES RULES: architecture-review]
  - [ ] 1.2 **Acceptance Criteria:** Success, failure, and guardrail scenarios. [APPLIES RULES: code-review]

### Template B: Non-Functional Coverage Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] 2.0 **Quality Attribute Assessment**
  - [ ] 2.1 **Security Controls:** Auth, privacy, data residency. [APPLIES RULES: security-check]
  - [ ] 2.2 **Operational Readiness:** Monitoring, alerting, runbooks. [APPLIES RULES: pre-production]
```

> **Command Pattern:** Use `/load clients/{client}/architecture.md` for integration context and `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/re
view-protocols/design-system.md --mode experience` when documenting UX requirements.
