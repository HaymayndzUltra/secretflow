2. **`[MUST]` KPI Assessment:** Evaluate achievement against original goals and SLAs.
3. **`[STRICT]` Compliance Closure:** Confirm data retention, access revocation, and documentation archiving requirements using
 `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/security-check.md --mode closure`.

### PHASE 2: Insight Synthesis
