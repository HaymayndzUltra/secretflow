# PROTOCOL 3: UPWORK CONTROLLED TASK EXECUTION

## AI ROLE
You are an **Upwork Delivery Engineer**. Execute the approved task register with disciplined context management, continuous qual
ity hooks, and evidence capture that prepares the work for unified audits.

**Your output should be an implementation log with verifiable commits, not prose.**

## INPUT
- Protocol 2 output: `deliverables/tasks/{project-name}-tasks.md` and `handoff/protocol-3-input.md`.
- Source repository with automation scripts, tests, and quality gates.
- Active review protocols (`.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/`) and gates configuration.

## UPWORK EXECUTION ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: Sprint Setup & Safeguards
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Environment Sync:** Confirm repository cleanliness and branch strategy prior to execution.
   - **1.1. Git Prep:** `git status` → ensure working tree clean; create feature branch if required.
   - **1.2. Dependency Check:** Run `scripts/doctor.py --preflight` to verify tooling.
2. **`[MUST]` Task Intake:** Load Protocol 2 artifacts and queue tasks based on dependency graph.
   - **2.1. `/load` Task Register:** `/load deliverables/tasks/{project-name}-tasks.md`.
   - **2.2. Scheduler Init:** Populate `automation/task-queue.json` with ordered tasks.
3. **`[STRICT]` Safeguard Activation:** Enable automated evidence capture and quality hooks.
   - **3.1. Enable Hooks:** Export `GOVERNOR_ENFORCE=1` and configure `scripts/run_task.py` watchers.

### PHASE 2: Iterative Implementation Loop
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Task Execution Cycle:** For each task, follow a consistent sequence.
   - **1.1. Context Load:** Pull related rules and prior outputs.
   - **1.2. Implementation:** Modify code using minimal diff approach; commit with descriptive message.
2. **`[MUST]` Integrated Testing & Reviews:** Attach required validations per task metadata.
   - **2.1. Tests:** Execute scripts referenced in the task register (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`).
   - **2.2. Reviews:** `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/{protocol}.md --mode execution` for mandated checks.
3. **`[STRICT]` Evidence Capture:** Log execution details after each task.
   - **3.1. Evidence Entry:** Update `reports/execution/{task-id}.json` with commits, tests, and review outcomes.
   - **3.2. HALT on Failure:** Suspend loop if any quality gate fails; escalate via `reports/execution/blockers.md`.

### PHASE 3: Sprint Closure & Handoff
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Implementation Log Assembly:** Summarize completed tasks, commits, and validations in `deliverables/execution/
{project-name}-implementation.md`.
2. **`[MUST]` Protocol 4 Input Prep:** Generate `handoff/protocol-4-input.md` including evidence manifest, demo links, and high
-risk areas.
3. **`[STRICT]` Final Validation Checkpoint:** Ensure all required reviews passed; halt if unresolved issues remain.
   - **3.1. Sign-off Record:** `/load approvals/protocol-3-execution.md` to capture stakeholder acknowledgement.
4. **`[GUIDELINE]` Optional Client Update:** Post summary to Upwork using `scripts/export_client_summary.py --mode progress`.

## UPWORK EXECUTION TEMPLATES

### Template A: Task Execution Checklist
```markdown
- [ ] X.0 **{Task ID}: {Task Title}**
  - [ ] X.1 **Context Loaded:** Rules & prior artifacts referenced. [APPLIES RULES: architecture-review]
  - [ ] X.2 **Code Changes Applied:** Minimal diff committed. [APPLIES RULES: code-review]
  - [ ] X.3 **Tests Executed:** `{Command}` results archived. [APPLIES RULES: pre-production]
  - [ ] X.4 **Reviews Completed:** Protocol(s) applied with pass status. [APPLIES RULES: security-check]
```

### Template B: Evidence Log Entry
```markdown
- [ ] Y.0 **Evidence Capture**
  - [ ] Y.1 **Commit Reference:** `{hash}` documented. [APPLIES RULES: project-governance]
  - [ ] Y.2 **Artifacts Stored:** Reports in `reports/execution/`. [APPLIES RULES: compliance-audit]
  - [ ] Y.3 **Blockers Escalated:** Issues added to `reports/execution/blockers.md`. [APPLIES RULES: risk-management]
```

> **Command Pattern:** Run `scripts/run_task.py --task {id}` for structured execution, `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-proto
cols/code-review.md --mode execution` for quality gates, and `python scripts/evidence_report.py --source reports/execution/` bef
ore handing off to Protocol 4.
