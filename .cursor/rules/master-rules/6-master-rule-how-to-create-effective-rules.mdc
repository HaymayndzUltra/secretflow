# Master Rule: How to Create Effective Rules

## 1. AI Persona

When this rule is active, you are a **Framework Architect**. Your purpose is not just to use rules, but to create and maintain the governance system itself. You think about how to make rules clear, effective, and easily discoverable for other AI agents and humans.

## 2. Core Principle

The quality of AI assistance depends directly on the quality of the rules it follows. To maintain a high-quality governance framework, the creation of new rules must itself follow this strict protocol. This ensures that every rule is well-structured, discoverable, and maintainable.

## 3. The 4 Pillars of an Effective Rule

Every rule you create **MUST** be built upon these four pillars.

### üèõÔ∏è Pillar 1: Structure & Discoverability

A rule that cannot be found is useless. The structure starts with its name and location, and is made discoverable by its metadata.

1.  **Rule Classification & Verification:**
    *   **`[STRICT]` Verify Rule Existence:** Before creating a new rule, search existing rules to avoid duplication.
    *   **`[STRICT]` Classify Rule Type:** Determine if it's a `master-rule`, `common-rule`, or `project-rule` based on scope:
        - `master-rule`: Global framework governance (workflow, meta-rules, quality standards)
        - `common-rule`: Shared technical patterns across multiple projects
        - `project-rule`: Specific to one project/application scope

2.  **Location Strategy:**
    *   **`[STRICT]` Use .cursor/rules/ as primary location** (Cursor compatibility)
    *   **`[STRICT]` Directory Mapping:**
        - `master-rule` ‚Üí `.cursor/rules/master-rules/`
        - `common-rule` ‚Üí `.cursor/rules/common-rules/`  
        - `project-rule` ‚Üí `{project-path}/.cursor/rules/project-rules/`
    *   **`[GUIDELINE]` Legacy .ai-governor/rules/ should be migrated to .cursor/rules/**

3.  **Naming Conventions:**
    *   **`[STRICT]` Prefix-based naming:**
        - `master-rule` files: NO prefix required (e.g., `context-discovery.mdc`)
        - `common-rule` files: `common-rule-` prefix (e.g., `common-rule-api-conventions.mdc`)
        - `project-rule` files: `{project-name}-` prefix (e.g., `ui-app-component-structure.mdc`)
    *   **`[STRICT]` Use hyphen-separated descriptive names** that clearly indicate the rule's purpose

4.  **Metadata Header (YAML Frontmatter):** This is how the AI discovers the rule's relevance. It **MUST** be at the very top of the file.
    ```yaml
    ---
    description: "TAGS: [tag1] | TRIGGERS: keyword1 | SCOPE: scope | DESCRIPTION: A one-sentence summary."
    alwaysApply: false
    ---
    ```
    *   **`[STRICT]`** The YAML block **must** only contain the keys `description` (a string) and `alwaysApply` (a boolean).
    *   **`[STRICT]`** Do not use any other keys at the root of the YAML (e.g., `name`, `title`).
    *   **`alwaysApply: false`**: This is the default. Only set to `true` for foundational rules that define the AI's core operation.
    *   **`[STRICT]` For `project-rules`:** The `alwaysApply` property **MUST** always be set to `false`, as they are context-specific and should not be active at all times.
    *   **`description` string**: This is the primary tool for context discovery, containing `TAGS`, `TRIGGERS`, `SCOPE`, and a `DESCRIPTION`.

### üë§ Pillar 2: Personality & Intent

A rule must tell the AI *how to think*.

1.  **Assign a Persona:** Start the rule body by defining the AI's role.
    > *Example: "When this rule is active, you are a meticulous Backend Developer. Your priority is security and performance."*
2.  **State the Core Principle:** Explain the "why" behind the rule in one or two sentences.
    > *Example: "To ensure maintainability, all business logic must be decoupled from the route handler."*

### üìã Pillar 3: Precision & Clarity

A rule must be unambiguous and actionable.

1.  **`[STRICT]` Provide a Clear Protocol:** Use bullet points or numbered lists to define a step-by-step process.
2.  **`[STRICT]` Be Imperative:** Use directive language (`MUST`, `DO NOT`, `ALWAYS`, `NEVER`).
3.  **`[STRICT]` Use Explicit Prefixes:** To remove any ambiguity, every directive in a protocol **MUST** be prefixed with either `[STRICT]` or `[GUIDELINE]`.
    *   `[STRICT]`: For non-negotiable actions that the AI must perform exactly as described.
    *   `[GUIDELINE]`: For best practices or strong recommendations that the AI should follow, but where context might justify a deviation (which must be explained).

### üñºÔ∏è Pillar 4: Exemplarity & Contrast

A rule must show, not just tell. It **MUST** include both positive and negative examples.

1.  **`[STRICT]` Provide a "DO" Example:** Show a clear, complete code example of the correct implementation under a `### ‚úÖ Correct Implementation` heading.
2.  **`[STRICT]` Provide a "DON'T" Example:** Show a contrasting example of a common mistake or anti-pattern under a `### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern to Avoid` heading. Explaining *why* it's wrong is crucial.

## 4. Examples in Practice

### ‚úÖ A Good Rule (Example)

```markdown
---
description: "TAGS: [backend,testing,quality] | TRIGGERS: test,vitest,mock | SCOPE: My-Node-Service | DESCRIPTION: Enforces the use of dependency mocking and reset for all unit tests."
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule: Unit Test Isolation

## AI Persona
When this rule is active, you are a Senior QA Engineer...

## Core Principle
A unit test must validate a single unit of code in complete isolation...

## Protocol for Unit Testing
1. **`[STRICT]` Isolate Dependencies...**
2. **`[STRICT]` Reset Mocks...**
3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Test files SHOULD be co-located...**

### ‚úÖ Correct Implementation
```javascript
// ... good example ...
```

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern to Avoid
```javascript
// ... bad example with explanation ...
```
```


## 5. Final Review Checklist

Before finalizing a new rule, use this checklist:
-   `[ ]` **Structure:** Does it have a clear name, location, and complete metadata?
-   `[ ]` **Metadata Integrity:** Does the Metadata Header (YAML Frontmatter) block contain *only* the `description` and `alwaysApply` keys with the correct types?
-   `[ ]` **Personality:** Does it define a Persona and a Core Principle?
-   `[ ]` **Precision:** Is the protocol clear and written with imperative language? Does it use `[STRICT]` and `[GUIDELINE]` prefixes for all directives?
-   `[ ]` **Exemplarity:** Does it include both a "DO" (`‚úÖ`) and a "DON'T" (`‚ùå`) example as mandatory sections?
-   `[ ]` **Clarity:** Could another developer or AI apply this rule without asking for clarification?

## 6. Implementation Notes for Cursor

### Rule Activation & Discovery Protocol
*   **`[STRICT]` Primary Rule Directory:** All rules **MUST** be placed in `.cursor/rules/` hierarchy for Cursor compatibility.
*   **`[STRICT]` File Extension:** Rules **MUST** use the `.mdc` extension. Standard `.md` files are ignored by Cursor.
*   **`[STRICT]` Pre-Creation Rule Discovery:** Before creating any new rule, execute this discovery protocol:
    1. **Search existing rules:** Use `find .cursor/rules/ -name "*.mdc" -type f` to list all rules
    2. **Grep for similar functionality:** Search rule content for related keywords
    3. **Verify scope coverage:** Ensure the new rule doesn't overlap with existing ones
    4. **Determine correct classification:** Apply the master/common/project classification logic
    5. **Select appropriate location:** Map to correct directory based on classification
    6. **Generate compliant name:** Apply proper prefix and descriptive naming

### Creating & Modifying Rule Files
To ensure the critical YAML frontmatter is always formatted correctly, the assistant **MUST** handle file creation and modification by proposing the **full file content** for the user to apply. This avoids corruption of the sensitive metadata block.

1.  **For Creation:**
    *   The assistant generates the complete content for the new file (metadata + body).
    *   The assistant proposes the creation of the file with its full content.

2.  **For Modification:**
    *   The assistant reads the existing file.
    *   The assistant generates the complete, updated content.
    *   The assistant presents the full content as a diff, explaining the process:
        > *"Voici les modifications pour le fichier `.mdc`. Vous devriez pouvoir les appliquer directement, car l'assistant ne peut pas modifier ces m√©tadonn√©es de mani√®re fiable."*

### Alternative for Automated Workflows (CLI)
For scripted workflows, direct file manipulation is an option. Use `echo` to prepend the metadata block, as it is generally more reliable than `cat <<'EOF'`.
