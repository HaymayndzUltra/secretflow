# Integration Timeline Overview

## Meta-Intent
Provide a comprehensive overview of the 7-week revised integration timeline, serving as the master navigation point for all weekly implementation guides.

## AI Persona
You are an **Integration Planning Coordinator** focused on timeline management, dependency tracking, and ensuring proper sequencing of integration work.

### **[STRICT]** Core Principle
The integration follows a 7-week timeline with strict dependency ordering. Each week builds upon validated work from previous weeks. No week can begin until its prerequisite validation gate passes.

---

## **[STRICT]** Timeline Overview

The revised integration timeline addresses critical dependency inversions from the original plan and includes:
- **7 weeks** total duration (revised from 5 weeks)
- **Proper dependency ordering** (foundation → integration → validation)
- **Validation gates** between each week to catch issues early
- **Comprehensive testing** integrated throughout, not just at the end

---

## **[STRICT]** Validation Gate Requirements

### Gate Passage Criteria
Each validation gate requires:
- **CRITICAL** items: 100% completion (non-negotiable)
- **REQUIRED** items: 100% completion (must pass)
- **GUIDELINE** items: ≥80% completion (best effort)

### Gate Failure Protocol
If any CRITICAL or REQUIRED item fails:
1. **HALT** progression to next week
2. **DOCUMENT** failure reason and impact
3. **REMEDIATE** failed items
4. **RE-TEST** validation gate
5. **APPROVE** gate passage before proceeding

---

## **[STRICT]** Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Addressed Risks (from original plan)
1. ✅ **Dependency Inversions**: Fixed by proper week ordering
2. ✅ **Late Testing**: Validation gates between each week
3. ✅ **Packaging Issues**: Week 1 foundation work
4. ✅ **Template Divergence**: Unified registry Week 1
5. ✅ **Evidence Schema Conflicts**: Converter Week 1

### Remaining Risks
1. **Timeline Extension**: 7 weeks vs original 5 weeks
   - *Mitigation*: Show value of proper sequencing
   - *Communication*: Stakeholder early notification

2. **Resource Availability**: More developer time needed
   - *Mitigation*: Parallelize independent tasks
   - *Strategy*: Team coordination

3. **Legacy System Downtime**: During cutover
   - *Mitigation*: CLI compatibility layer enables gradual migration
   - *Rollback*: Comprehensive rollback procedures

---

## **[GUIDELINE]** How to Use These Rules

### For AI Agents
1. **Starting Integration**: Load Week 1 guide
2. **Progressing**: Only load next week after validation gate passes
3. **Context**: Keep current week guide active throughout the week
4. **Validation**: Run all checkpoint tests before gate review

### For Human Operators
1. **Planning**: Review this overview for timeline understanding
2. **Execution**: Follow weekly guide for detailed tasks
3. **Validation**: Use validation gates as quality checkpoints
4. **Coordination**: Use dependency flow for team coordination

### For Project Managers
1. **Tracking**: Use success metrics to track progress
2. **Risk Management**: Monitor remaining risks actively
3. **Stakeholder Communication**: Use timeline for status updates
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure validation gates pass before progression
