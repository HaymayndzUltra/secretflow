# Protocol 1 · Product Requirements Definition (PRD)

## Purpose & Role
- **Role:** Product Discovery Lead collaborating with stakeholders across product, engineering, design, QA, and operations.
- **Mission:** Capture a validated, end-to-end specification that links business outcomes to user experience, technical architecture, quality expectations, and delivery constraints.
- **Success Criteria:** Approved PRD file, architecture alignment summary, prioritized backlog of open questions, and clear handoff to task generation.

## Required Inputs
- Approved Context Kit from Protocol 0.
- Named stakeholders for product, engineering, QA, security/compliance, and operations.
- Access to historical analytics, customer feedback, or support tickets relevant to the problem space.
- Applicable rule sets, standards, or regulatory requirements.

## Expected Outputs
1. PRD file stored in a version-controlled location.
2. Architecture placement statement identifying primary and secondary implementation layers.
3. Business logic specification detailing key domain rules, decision tables, and state transitions.
4. Acceptance criteria matrix covering functional, non-functional, and business validation.
5. Initial testing & release strategy summary (unit, integration, e2e, manual, monitoring).
6. Open issues log for deferred questions or assumptions.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 0 · Preparation
1. Review Context Kit, confirm stakeholder availability, and re-apply any updated rule sets.
2. Define interview agenda covering business, user, technical, and operational angles.
3. Prepare data capture template (use the PRD structure below) to avoid missing sections.

### Phase 1 · Business & Stakeholder Discovery
1. Clarify problem statement, business goals, KPIs, and success metrics.
2. Identify target users, personas, or consuming systems.
3. Capture business priorities, release deadlines, and go-to-market considerations.
4. Record compliance, security, accessibility, localization, and privacy constraints.
5. Confirm budget or capacity boundaries that influence scope.

### Phase 2 · User Experience & Workflow Analysis
1. Document user journeys, service workflows, or API sequence diagrams.
2. Break down primary scenarios into steps, decision points, and triggers.
3. Capture edge cases, error states, rollback behavior, and audit requirements.
4. Map content/communication needs (emails, notifications, documentation updates).

### Phase 3 · Business Logic & Data Definition
1. Identify domain entities, data contracts, and storage impacts.
2. Define business rules (calculations, validations, approvals) and represent them as tables or flowcharts.
3. Note dependencies on reference data, third-party services, or machine learning models.
4. Record required migrations, seeding, or backfill work at a high level.

### Phase 4 · Technical & Architectural Alignment
1. Determine primary implementation layer (e.g., client app, backend service, data pipeline) and secondary touchpoints.
2. Document integration points: internal APIs, external services, event streams, batch jobs.
3. Capture performance, scalability, availability, and observability targets.
4. Align on deployment strategy (environments, rollout plan, feature flags, compliance gates).
5. Validate feasibility with engineering leads; capture risks and mitigation strategies.

### Phase 5 · Quality, Testing, & Support Plan
1. Define acceptance criteria per scenario using Given/When/Then or input/output tables.
2. Outline testing approach: unit, integration, contract, E2E, exploratory/manual, regression, security scans.
3. Specify monitoring, alerting, analytics, and support handoff requirements.
4. Establish documentation deliverables (README updates, runbooks, API references, change logs).

### Phase 6 · PRD Consolidation & Sign-off
1. Populate the PRD template (below) with validated information and flag open questions.
2. Circulate the draft for stakeholder review; track feedback and decisions.
3. Finalize sign-off status, approval owners, and date.
4. Produce a handoff note for Protocol 2 summarizing:
   - Final scope and success metrics
   - Architecture placement and impacted systems
   - Confirmed quality expectations and deployment strategy
   - Outstanding questions for task generation or design

## Quality Gates & Checkpoints
- **Stakeholder Alignment Gate:** All primary stakeholder groups review and confirm sections relevant to them.
- **Business Logic Gate:** Decision tables and domain rules reviewed by subject-matter experts.
- **Architecture Gate:** Engineering lead approves layer placement and integration impacts.
- **Testing Strategy Gate:** QA lead validates coverage and test environments.
- **Sign-off Gate:** PRD stored in version control with approval record.

## Transition to Protocol 2
Proceed to `2-generate-tasks.md` only when:
1. PRD sign-off is complete and documented.
2. Open questions are clearly assigned with due dates or flagged as scope exclusions.
3. Architecture placement and quality expectations are unambiguous.
4. Required documentation links are included in the PRD or Context Kit update.

*This protocol ensures the team moves into task planning with validated requirements, business logic, and architectural direction.*
