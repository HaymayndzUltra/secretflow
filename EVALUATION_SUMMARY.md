## Winner: VERSION_A (8.65/10)

### Scoring Breakdown

| Report | Evidence | Technical | Complete | Practical | Consistent | Risk | **Total** |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|------|-----------|
| **A**  | **2.70** | **2.25**  | 1.20     | 1.20      | **0.90**   | 0.40 | **8.65**  |
| C      | **2.70** | 2.00      | **1.35** | 1.20      | **0.90**   | 0.40 | 8.55      |
| D      | 0.60     | 1.50      | 1.20     | 1.05      | 0.80       | 0.35 | 5.50      |
| B      | 0.90     | 1.25      | 0.90     | 0.75      | 0.70       | 0.30 | 4.80      |

### Why VERSION_A Won

1. **Critical Technical Discovery:** ONLY report to identify fatal packaging flaw - `scripts/` lacks `__init__.py`, making all `from scripts.lifecycle_tasks` imports impossible as written in INTEGRATION_PLAN.md

2. **Superior Evidence Quality:** 24 precise file:line citations (【F:filename†LX-LY】), all verified against actual code

3. **Unique Technical Insights:** 
   - Identified sys.path.insert(0, str(ROOT)) manipulation in validate_compliance_assets.py:12-13
   - Correctly noted timeline dependency inversion (Week 2 needs Week 3 templates)
   - Documented template registry duplication risk between project_generator and unified workflow

4. **Highest Technical Correctness:** 9/10 - all architectural claims verified against actual repository structure

### Key Verification Results

**Citation Verification:**
- VERSION_A: 24 citations, **100% verifiable**, all major claims backed by code
- VERSION_C: 26 citations, **100% verifiable**, excellent completeness
- VERSION_B: 13 vague references, **0% verifiable** (no line numbers)
- VERSION_D: 0 citations, **0% verifiable** (general statements only)

**Critical Code Verification:**
- ✅ Confirmed: `scripts/__init__.py` does NOT exist (VERSION_A correct)
- ✅ Confirmed: `scripts/workflow_automation/__init__.py` exists but parent not a package
- ✅ Confirmed: `validate_compliance_assets.py:12-13` uses `sys.path.insert(0, str(ROOT))`
- ✅ Confirmed: `project_generator/templates/registry.py` points to `template-packs/`
- ✅ Confirmed: `workflow1/codex-phase2-design/scripts/` directory exists (automation at risk)
- ✅ Confirmed: 40+ Python scripts in `scripts/` per scripts/README.md

## Merged Insights (From Non-Winners)

While VERSION_A is the clear winner, valuable insights from other reports include:

1. **From VERSION_C:** CLI compatibility layer with telemetry-driven deprecation strategy
2. **From VERSION_C:** External services integration (Git, AI governor, policy DSL) identification
3. **From VERSION_D:** Explicit artifact validation against evidence/schema.json checkpoint
4. **From VERSION_D:** Phase-specific testing gates at week boundaries

## Critical Risks Identified

| Risk | Severity | Source | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| Non-package import failures | **CRITICAL** | VERSION_A | Add scripts/__init__.py, refactor sys.path usage |
| Template registry divergence | **HIGH** | VERSION_A, C | Build shared TemplateRegistry service |
| Protocol automation loss | **HIGH** | VERSION_A, C | Catalog and preserve workflow1/*/scripts/ |
| Schedule underestimation | **MEDIUM** | VERSION_A | Add 2 weeks (7-week vs 5-week plan) |

## Implementation Readiness: PROCEED WITH MAJOR MODIFICATIONS

**Status:** The INTEGRATION_PLAN.md requires substantial modifications before implementation.

**Blockers Identified:**
1. Packaging structure prevents imports as written
2. Template consolidation strategy undefined
3. Protocol automation preservation not planned
4. Timeline has dependency inversions

**Recommendation:** Execute the 8-step action plan from EVALUATION_RESULT.json starting with:
1. Create comprehensive script inventory with packaging audit
2. Design template registry consolidation
3. Catalog workflow1 automation assets
4. Resolve evidence schema conflicts
5. Resequence integration timeline

**Estimated Adjustment:** Add 2 weeks for infrastructure fixes (7-week total).

## Action Plan Summary

The evaluation produced an 8-step implementation plan with:
- Every step tied to specific code citations
- Explicit risk statements for each step
- Concrete mitigation strategies
- Sequencing that resolves dependency inversions

**Next Immediate Action:** Start with Step 1 (script inventory and packaging audit) before any integration work begins.
