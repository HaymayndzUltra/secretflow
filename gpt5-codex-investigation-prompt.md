# GPT-5-CODEX Investigation Prompt: SecretFlow Dev-Workflow Enhancement

## üéØ MISSION BRIEFING

You are GPT-5-CODEX, tasked with conducting a comprehensive investigation of the SecretFlow development workflow system. Your mission is to analyze the current AI-driven protocol architecture and determine how to optimize it for complete end-to-end project delivery from client requirements to production deployment.

## üìã CONTEXT: What is SecretFlow Dev-Workflow?

The SecretFlow dev-workflow is an **AI-driven protocol system** designed to guide development teams through structured project delivery. It consists of:

- **Bootstrap Protocol** (`0-bootstrap-your-project.md`) - Initial project analysis and context engineering
- **PRD Creation** (`1-create-prd.md`) - Product Requirements Document generation
- **Task Generation** (`2-generate-tasks.md`) - Breaking down requirements into actionable tasks
- **Task Processing** (`3-process-tasks.md`) - Implementation workflow
- **Quality Audit** (`4-quality-audit.md`) - Code quality and review protocols
- **Implementation Retrospective** (`5-implementation-retrospective.md`) - Learning and improvement
- **Review Protocols** (`review-protocols/`) - Specialized review frameworks

This system is designed to work with AI assistants to provide consistent, high-quality project delivery.

## üîç INVESTIGATION SCOPE

You must thoroughly analyze these components to understand their current state and integration potential:

### Primary Analysis Targets:
1. **Core Workflow** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/.cursor/dev-workflow/`)
   - All workflow files and their interconnections
   - Current process flow and dependencies
   - Gaps in the end-to-end delivery pipeline

2. **Rule System** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/.cursor/rules/`)
   - Master rules and common rules structure
   - How rules integrate with the workflow
   - Rule enforcement mechanisms

3. **Integration Candidates** (Analyze if these should be part of the workflow):
   - **Template Packs** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/template-packs/`)
   - **Scripts** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/scripts/`)
   - **Project Generator** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/project_generator/`)
   - **GitHub Workflows** (`/home/haymayndz/secretflow/.github/`)

### Secondary Analysis (if needed):
- **Entire Codebase** - Only if primary analysis reveals significant gaps

## üß† ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: Understanding Current Architecture
1. **Map the Current Workflow**
   - Document each step in the dev-workflow
   - Identify input/output dependencies between steps
   - Understand the AI-human collaboration model
   - Note any existing automation or tooling

2. **Analyze Rule Integration**
   - How do rules guide each workflow step?
   - What enforcement mechanisms exist?
   - Are there gaps in rule coverage?

### Phase 2: Component Analysis
For each integration candidate, determine:
1. **Purpose and Functionality**
   - What does this component do?
   - What problems does it solve?
   - What are its inputs and outputs?

2. **Workflow Integration Potential**
   - Which workflow steps could benefit from this component?
   - How would it enhance the current process?
   - What dependencies would it create?

3. **End-to-End Impact**
   - How does this component contribute to complete project delivery?
   - What gaps would it fill?
   - Would it create new dependencies or complexity?

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis
1. **Identify Missing Capabilities**
   - What's needed for true end-to-end delivery?
   - Where are manual processes that could be automated?
   - What client-facing capabilities are missing?

2. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Which components should be integrated?
   - What new components might be needed?
   - How should the workflow be restructured?
