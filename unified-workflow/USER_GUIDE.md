3. **Review Process**: Approvers review and provide feedback
4. **Decision**: Approve, reject, or request changes
5. **Progression**: Workflow continues based on decision

## Evidence System

### Evidence Types

1. **Manifest**: Project metadata and phase information
2. **Run Log**: Execution history and timing
3. **Validation**: Quality and validation results
4. **Artifacts**: Generated files and outputs

### Evidence Structure

```
evidence/
├── phase0/
│   ├── manifest.json
│   ├── run.log
│   ├── validation.md
│   └── artifacts/
├── phase1/
