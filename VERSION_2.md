AI-Governed Upwork Delivery Blueprint

## 1. Current System Summary
### Architecture & Knowledge Management
- The repository treats governance content as an in-repo knowledge base so assistants can consult rules and architectural READMEs on demand, preserving decisions with full version control and low-latency access.【F:README.md†L1-L29】
- Governance is split between a passive rule engine (`/rules`) that enforces standards automatically and an operator playbook (`/dev-workflow`) that humans trigger to move work through structured protocols.【F:README.md†L33-L58】
- Rule governance uses a three-layer hierarchy (foundation, execution, specialization) to stage context, with master/common/project rules defining non-negotiables, shared conventions, and stack-specific practices respectively.【F:.cursor/rules/README.md†L1-L63】

### Workflow Orchestration
- The optimized five-protocol lifecycle (bootstrap, PRD, task planning, implementation with audits, retrospective) positions the AI as analyst, product manager, tech lead, paired developer, and reviewer across sequential sessions, keeping the human in approval loops for each protocol hand-off.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L1-L120】
- Unified review protocols provide a single `/review`/`@review` orchestrator with interactive mode selection, intelligent custom-to-generic fallback, and enhanced static review utilities that analyze git context and filter rule scope for efficient audits.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L1-L160】【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/utils/README.md†L1-L33】
- Cursor prompts expose the same orchestrator inside the IDE, making comprehensive review modes, security checks, and architectural validations available via one command with automatic fallback and team-specific usage patterns.【F:.cursor/prompts/README.md†L1-L190】

### Code Generation & Templates
- `project_generator` is a Python package that parses briefs, applies industry configurations, validates stack/compliance combinations, and generates full codebases plus optional post-processing like git init and pre-commit setup.【F:project_generator/README.md†L1-L84】
- Template packs supply canonical frontend, backend, database, DevEx, CI/CD, and policy scaffolds with manifests so the generator can discover variants and copy the right assets while respecting customization guardrails.【F:template-packs/README.md†L1-L41】

### Operational Tooling & Evidence
- The `scripts` suite spans high-priority automation for coverage, gates, PRD/task validation, context syncing, and workflow orchestration, with smoke harnesses and priority catalogs enabling CI-friendly execution.【F:scripts/README.md†L1-L117】
- Workflow templates define declarative YAML playbooks, evidence schemas, and submission checklists that downstream automation consumes to maintain audit trails.【F:workflow/README.md†L1-L40】
- `workflow1` packages lifecycle phases (0–6) with protocols, templates, and scripts that populate evidence manifests, ensuring each milestone records artifacts and run logs aligned to the schema.【F:workflow1/README.md†L1-L73】

## 2. End-to-End AI-Driven Delivery Approach
1. **Context Bootstrapping** – Use the bootstrap protocol to generate project-specific rules and READMEs so any assistant inherits domain knowledge before touching code.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L18-L39】【F:.cursor/rules/README.md†L37-L63】
2. **Structured Discovery & Planning** – Run PRD and task-generation protocols to turn briefs into implementation roadmaps, leveraging `plan_from_brief.py` and workflow evidence requirements to keep planning auditable.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L28-L52】【F:scripts/README.md†L31-L55】
3. **Automated Scaffolding** – Feed approved briefs into `project_generator` via `generate_from_brief.py`/`generate_client_project.py`, pulling template packs and compliance assets automatically.【F:project_generator/README.md†L18-L84】【F:scripts/README.md†L35-L53】【F:template-packs/README.md†L5-L35】
4. **Governed Implementation** – Execute tasks sequentially with the implementation protocol, invoking unified reviews after each parent task to apply code, security, architecture, and UX checks with context-aware rule injection.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L52-L113】【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L19-L109】
5. **Lifecycle Evidence Automation** – For each workflow1 phase, trigger packaged scripts to generate artifacts and update manifests while workflow templates and automation scripts enforce gate criteria and evidence schema compliance.【F:workflow1/README.md†L14-L73】【F:workflow/README.md†L1-L36】【F:scripts/README.md†L35-L117】
6. **Delivery & Operations** – Use submission checklist templates, build/deploy helpers, and operations-phase scripts to bundle deliverables and monitor post-launch obligations, with humans signing off on gate reports and evidence packs before release.【F:workflow/README.md†L16-L40】【F:scripts/README.md†L99-L117】【F:workflow1/README.md†L39-L73】

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan (AI-Led with Human Validation)
| Phase | Objective | AI Actions | Outputs & Storage | Human Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **0. Bootstrap** | Establish governed context for the client repo. | Run `0-bootstrap-your-project.md` to generate project rules/READMEs; normalize rules using automation scripts if needed. | Updated `.cursor/rules/project-rules`, context kit summary, bootstrap log stored per workflow1 evidence structure. | Confirm rules reflect client architecture/constraints before unlocking downstream protocols.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L18-L39】【F:.cursor/rules/README.md†L37-L63】 |
| **1. Discovery & PRD** | Translate client brief into a governed PRD. | Execute PRD protocol, optionally call `generate_prd_assets.py` for evidence packaging; log outputs into workflow1 phase1 directories. | PRD markdown, context notes, manifest entries under `workflow1/evidence/phase1`. | Approve PRD scope, acceptance criteria, and compliance coverage before task planning.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L28-L39】【F:scripts/README.md†L35-L47】 |
| **2. Planning** | Produce actionable task graph and architecture assets. | Run task-generation protocol; use `plan_from_brief.py` plus workflow1 phase2 scripts to generate architecture packs and contracts. | `PLAN.md`, `tasks.json`, architecture bundle, updated manifest & run logs. | Validate tasks sequencing, architecture decisions, and manifest completeness before implementation.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L40-L99】【F:workflow1/README.md†L20-L37】【F:scripts/README.md†L35-L55】 |
| **3. Scaffolding & Environment** | Generate repo baseline consistent with plan. | Execute generator CLIs to scaffold frontend/backend/database, copy template packs, run `write_context_report.py`, sync workflow templates. | Generated codebase, DevEx/CI assets, context report, template manifests recorded in evidence phase3 staging area. | Verify scaffold alignment with plan (stack choices, compliance assets) and approve before feature work.【F:project_generator/README.md†L18-L84】【F:template-packs/README.md†L5-L35】【F:scripts/README.md†L35-L53】 |
| **4. Implementation & Quality Rails** | Deliver planned features with continuous gating. | For each parent task, follow implementation protocol, run unified `/review` to choose quality modes, and trigger workflow1 phase3 scripts for quality gates. | Feature branches/commits, review transcripts, updated gate metrics, evidence manifests/logs. | Approve `/review` outcomes, gate reports, and remediation before merging; halt progression on failed criteria.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/README.md†L52-L113】【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L44-L109】【F:workflow1/README.md†L27-L33】 |
| **5. Integration & Launch Prep** | Validate integrations and release readiness. | Run workflow1 phase4 & phase5 scripts (observability packs, staging smoke, rollback drills), update manifests per evidence schema. | Observability specs, smoke test outputs, deployment runbooks with checksums logged. | Review integration reports, rehearsal outcomes, and ensure submission checklist criteria met before production launch.【F:workflow1/README.md†L33-L45】【F:workflow/README.md†L16-L40】 |
| **6. Deployment & Delivery** | Ship client deliverables and documentation. | Execute deployment helpers (`deploy_backend.sh`, `build_submission_pack.sh`), compile evidence per submission checklist, archive metrics from automation scripts. | Packaged submission bundle, signed manifests, deployment logs in workflow evidence folders. | Approve final bundle contents, evidence completeness, and gate statuses before client handoff.【F:scripts/README.md†L99-L117】【F:workflow/README.md†L16-L40】 |
| **7. Operations & Continuous Governance** | Maintain solution post-launch with minimal oversight. | Run operations scripts (SLO monitoring, retros scheduling), update phase6 manifests, schedule periodic rule audits via automation. | SLO reports, retro schedules, dependency/security logs appended to evidence trail. | Validate SLO targets and operational commitments; authorize adjustments or follow-up tasks.【F:workflow1/README.md†L43-L73】【F:scripts/README.md†L65-L117】 |

## 4. Validation Cadence & Tooling Notes
- **Cursor/Codex Invocation** – Use the unified `@review`/`Apply instructions from ...` commands to drive protocols end-to-end with automatic fallback, ensuring the same workflow runs identically in Cursor AI or Codex via file-based prompts.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/README.md†L44-L92】【F:.cursor/prompts/README.md†L23-L170】
- **Evidence Governance** – All automation must update `workflow/templates/evidence_schema.json`-compliant manifests and leverage workflow1 run logs so human reviewers can audit checksum, timestamp, and artifact provenance before approving transitions.【F:workflow/README.md†L16-L40】【F:workflow1/README.md†L47-L73】
- **Automation Safety Nets** – Enhanced static review utilities and the scripts priority catalog provide measurable checkpoints (coverage, dependency scans, performance, compliance) that the human validator inspects before unlocking the next phase.【F:.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/utils/README.md†L9-L30】【F:scripts/README.md†L33-L117】

This blueprint lets AI systems execute every stage of the SDLC while reserving strategic approvals and final accountability for you as the Upwork operator.
