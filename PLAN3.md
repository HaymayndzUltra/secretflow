+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+This guide documents the standardized AI Protocol System format extracted from `Reviewme.md` and aligned with SecretFlow governance practices.
+
+## 1. Core Principles
+- **Role-Driven Execution:** Every protocol defines a specialized AI persona and mission to constrain behavior.
+- **Directive Hierarchy:** `[CRITICAL]` → `[MUST]` → `[STRICT]` → `[GUIDELINE]` control compliance priority.
+- **Sequential Phases:** Algorithms are broken into ordered phases (`PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3+`) with numbered actions.
+- **Validation Gates:** Mandatory pauses ensure human confirmation before advancing to risky steps.
+- **Template Orchestration:** Reusable task templates accelerate consistent delivery and embed rule packs via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+
+## 2. Protocol Layout
+```markdown
+# PROTOCOL {index}: {Title}
+
+## AI ROLE
+{Persona description and mission}
+
+## INPUT
+- Required documents, repositories, or environmental context
+- Preconditions or linked rule files
+
+## ALGORITHM
+### PHASE 1: {Name}
+1. **`[CRITICAL]` {Action}** – Non-negotiable step executed before anything else.
+2. **`[MUST]` {Action}** – Mandatory tasks that can follow once CRITICAL items are satisfied.
+3. **`[STRICT]` {Action}** – Hard requirements with allowed contingencies.
+4. **`[GUIDELINE]` {Action}** – Best practices to improve quality without blocking progress.
+
+### PHASE 2: {Name}
+...repeat structure...
+
+### PHASE 3: {Name}
+...repeat structure and embed **HALT AND AWAIT** checkpoints where needed...
+
+## TEMPLATES
+### Template A: {Use Case}
+```markdown
+- [ ] {Task} [APPLIES RULES: {rule-pack}]
+  - [ ] {Sub-task}
+```
+
+### Template B: {Use Case}
+...
+
+## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE
+```markdown
+# {Deliverable Title}
+
+## Section 1
+- **Metadata:** [...]
+
+## Section 2
+- Checklist / evidence capture
+```
+```
+
+## 3. Directive Hierarchy Details
+| Directive | Description | Enforcement |
+| --- | --- | --- |
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Highest-priority guardrails that must run before any other operation. | Hard stop if unmet. |
+| `[MUST]` | Required tasks ensuring completeness or safety. | Failing to execute invalidates protocol. |
+| `[STRICT]` | Rigid requirements often tied to compliance rules. | Deviation requires documented approval. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Recommended optimizations or quality enhancers. | Optional but encouraged. |
+
+## 4. Validation Checkpoints
+- **HALT Statements:** “**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit user confirmation” ensures synchronization.
+- **Clarification Prompts:** “**AWAIT ANSWERS** before proceeding” harvests missing context.
+- **Quality Announcements:** `[QUALITY GATE]` messages prepare stakeholders for audits.
+
+## 5. Template System Integration
+- **Rule Binding:** Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` to load governance packs (e.g., coding standards, testing protocols).
+- **Command Hooks:** Support `@apply {template}` and `/load {rule-pack}` for automation compatibility.
+- **Evidence Logging:** Templates request success criteria, dependencies, and validation notes for audit trails.
+
+## 6. Usage Workflow
+1. **Select Protocol:** Choose the domain file (content, data, project, client).
+2. **Load Rules:** Execute any referenced rule files before starting (`/load rules/{pack}.md`).
+3. **Follow Phases Sequentially:** Do not reorder phases; obey directive hierarchy.
+4. **Respect Checkpoints:** Pause whenever the protocol instructs; capture user approvals.
+5. **Produce Final Output:** Populate the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE and link supporting evidence.
+
+## 7. Extending the System
+- Start from `templates/protocol-template.md`.
+- Define new personas consistent with SecretFlow roles.
+- Align directives with repository security and quality policies.
+- Register new rule packs or templates in the Template Library for discoverability.
+
+## 8. References
+- Detailed conversation analysis: `analysis-report.md`.
+- Domain-specific protocols: see subdirectories under `ai-protocol-examples/`.
+
+Adhering to this guide ensures every AI workflow remains auditable, predictable, and aligned with SecretFlow’s governance expectations.

+# AI Protocol System Analysis Report
+
+## 1. Conversation Overview
+- **Source:** `Reviewme.md` (2,222-line Cursor IDE export)
+- **Primary Topics:** AI governance, protocol-driven collaboration, directive hierarchy, validation gates, template orchestration, SecretFlow infrastructure alignment.
+
+## 2. AI Governance Framework Components
+1. **Role-Based Personas**
+   - Specialized assignments (e.g., AI Codebase Analyst, Product Manager, Tech Lead) define scope, tone, and allowable tooling before execution.【F:Reviewme.md†L28-L75】
+   - Personas enforce contextual expertise and prevent generic assistant responses.
+2. **Directive Hierarchy**
+   - Priority ladder: `[CRITICAL]` → `[MUST]` → `[STRICT]` → `[GUIDELINE]` governs compliance, sequencing, and escalation.【F:Reviewme.md†L60-L75】
+   - Directives apply to tool usage, environment validation, and collaboration checkpoints.
+3. **Sequential Execution Flow**
+   - Protocols require numbered steps (`STEP 1`, `STEP 2`, …) and multi-phase algorithms that prohibit reordering.【F:Reviewme.md†L82-L104】
+   - Each step declares objective, actions, and confirmation requirements.
+4. **Validation Checkpoints**
+   - Mandatory halt statements (e.g., “**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit user confirmation”) form embedded quality gates.【F:Reviewme.md†L105-L126】
+   - Checkpoints synchronize AI actions with human oversight.
+5. **Template System Architecture**
+   - Protocols link to reusable task templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement) invoked via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags for compliance automation.【F:Reviewme.md†L400-L474】
+6. **Quality Assurance Integration**
+   - Built-in audit commands (`/review`, quality gate announcements) standardize verification before completion.【F:Reviewme.md†L118-L123】
+
+## 3. Protocol-Driven Collaboration Patterns
+| Pattern | Description | Effect |
+| --- | --- | --- |
+| **Mission Framing** | AI ROLE + mission statements tailor reasoning modes. | Aligns assistant mindset with domain goals.【F:Reviewme.md†L37-L54】 |
+| **Tooling Activation** | Initial directives discover tooling, load rules, and confirm environment readiness. | Ensures safe, reproducible execution.【F:Reviewme.md†L55-L80】 |
+| **Context Acquisition** | `[CRITICAL]` instructions to read rule files and project artifacts. | Prevents hallucinations and enforces evidence-driven outputs.【F:Reviewme.md†L107-L114】 |
+| **Communication Standards** | Required status callouts (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`). | Creates audit trail and cross-agent interoperability.【F:Reviewme.md†L115-L117】 |
+
+## 4. Template & Format Patterns
+- **Canonical Sections:** `# PROTOCOL {n}`, `## AI ROLE`, `## INPUT`, `## ALGORITHM` (with PHASE 1..n), `## TEMPLATES`, `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`.
+- **Phase Design:** Each phase decomposes into enumerated steps with directive prefixes, environment commands, and validation halts.
+- **Rule Binding:** `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` anchors downstream work to governance packs.
+- **Final Output:** Standardized markdown deliverables with checklists, metadata, and evidence fields.【F:Reviewme.md†L430-L474】
+
+## 5. Client Workflow Development Insights
+1. **Bootstrap Analysis:** Protocols begin with discovery—asset detection, stakeholder mapping, charter parsing—to ground subsequent automation.【F:Reviewme.md†L201-L275】【F:Reviewme.md†L430-L474】
+2. **User Collaboration:** Continuous validations (strategy confirmation, “reply ‘Go’”) embed human approval loops.【F:Reviewme.md†L236-L268】【F:Reviewme.md†L452-L462】
+3. **Evidence Tracking:** Templates prompt for success criteria, dependencies, and audit items, aligning with quality audit requirements.
+4. **Infrastructure Alignment:** Protocols reference filesystem inspections (`find . -name ...`), rule loading, and command invocations consistent with SecretFlow tooling expectations.【F:Reviewme.md†L213-L229】
+
+## 6. Integration Patterns with SecretFlow
+- **Command Syntax:** Encourages `@apply`, `/review`, and rule loading to sync with repository automation hooks.
+- **Quality Gates:** Mirrors SecretFlow’s quality audit files (`gates_config.yaml`) by embedding validation before status transitions.
+- **Template Compatibility:** Supports dynamic generation of execution files (`execution-[project].md`) aligning with repository structure conventions.【F:Reviewme.md†L440-L474】
+
+## 7. Best Practices Identified
+1. **Enforce Directive Hierarchy** to maintain deterministic behavior.
+2. **Use Phase Gates** to modularize reasoning and allow multi-agent handoffs.
+3. **Embed Validation Questions** to capture missing context before action.
+4. **Provide Reusable Templates** to standardize outputs across domains.
+5. **Document Communication Standards** to ensure interoperability across AI agents and human reviewers.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+The conversation demonstrates a robust AI Protocol System that governs agent behavior through layered directives, sequential workflows, and reusable templates. Applying these structures across new domains yields predictable, auditable outcomes that integrate seamlessly with SecretFlow’s governance and quality frameworks.

+# AI Protocol System Integration Guide
+
+This guide explains how to operationalize the AI Protocol System within the SecretFlow repository and broader delivery ecosystem.
+
+## 1. Prerequisites
+- **Access Controls:** Enable MFA on all contributor accounts and limit tokens to required repos.
+- **Execution Modes:** Use Read-Only mode for reconnaissance; switch to Agent mode only for approved edits.
+- **Toolchain:** Ensure `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`, and repository-specific scripts are available in the workspace.
+
+## 2. Integration Workflow
+### STEP 1 – Load Governance Packs
+1. Run `/load rules/{pack}.md` for each `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` directive referenced in the protocol.
+2. Confirm successful loading using `[TASK STATUS] Rules {pack} loaded` message.
+
+### STEP 2 – Initialize Protocol Execution
+1. Open the appropriate protocol file (e.g., `content-creation/0-content-strategy-bootstrap.md`).
+2. Provide the required INPUT context (charter, datasets, stakeholder roster) to the assigned AI persona.
+3. Trigger automation via `@apply protocol {file-path}` when using compatible orchestration tools.
+
+### STEP 3 – Enforce Validation Gates
+1. Respect all `HALT AND AWAIT` statements; record user approvals in meeting notes or ticket comments.
+2. Use `/review` or repository audit scripts after each phase marked `[QUALITY GATE]`.
+3. Document responses to clarification prompts directly in the protocol output.
+
+### STEP 4 – Generate Deliverables
+1. Populate the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE with collected evidence, metrics, and links.
+2. Attach artifacts (dashboards, PRs, notebooks) referenced in the deliverable to maintain traceability.
+3. Submit outputs through existing workflow tools (e.g., GitHub PR, SecretFlow Workboard).
+
+## 3. Quality Assurance Alignment
+- **Audit Hooks:** Align protocol checkpoints with `gates_config.yaml` to ensure automated QA parity.
+- **Testing Commands:** For engineering tasks, run `pytest`, `ruff`, or project-specific linters before marking tasks complete.
+- **Evidence Logging:** Store validation results in protocol output or linked audit files for compliance reviews.
+
+## 4. Command Patterns
+| Command | Purpose |
+| --- | --- |
+| `@apply protocol {file}` | Load and execute protocol via automation framework. |
+| `/load rules/{pack}.md` | Pull rule definitions into the session memory. |
+| `/review` | Trigger comprehensive quality audit across deliverables. |
+| `@status {message}` | Broadcast checkpoint updates to collaborators. |
+
+## 5. Integration with SecretFlow Assets
+- **Templates:** Store reusable templates under `template-packs/` and reference them using `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+- **Scripts:** Leverage `scripts/` utilities for data pulls, environment checks, and deployment previews.
+- **Documentation:** Update `docs/` or workflow knowledge bases with protocol outcomes for institutional learning.
+
+## 6. Governance and Security
+- Capture approvals for deviations from `[STRICT]` requirements in change control logs.
+- Avoid embedding secrets; rely on environment configurations or Vault-managed variables.
+- Require human review before merging changes generated through protocol executions.
+
+## 7. Continuous Improvement
+- Feed retrospective insights into protocol updates via `workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md` or equivalent processes.
+- Version templates and rule packs to track evolution and support rollback if regressions occur.
+
+Following this integration workflow ensures AI Protocol Systems operate reliably within SecretFlow’s security, quality, and collaboration standards.
