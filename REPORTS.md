+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+## Purpose
+
+This guide documents the standardized AI Protocol System format reverse-engineered from the SecretFlow workflow conversation. Use it to design domain-specific protocols that remain interoperable with the governance ecosystem.【F:Reviewme.md†L1-L120】
+
+## Core Structure
+
+Every protocol must follow this structure:
+
+1. `# PROTOCOL {index}: {Title}` – Provide scope and numbering.
+2. `## AI ROLE` – Assign a specialized persona and mission.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L110】
+3. `## INPUT` – Declare required context, assets, and prerequisites.【F:Reviewme.md†L360-L420】
+4. `## ALGORITHM` – Break execution into `PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, and `PHASE 3` (add optional phases as needed) containing sequential steps labeled `STEP 1`, `STEP 2`, etc.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】【F:Reviewme.md†L360-L480】
+5. `## TEMPLATES` – Supply reusable checklists or scaffolding with `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` bindings to the rule library.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+6. `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE` – Standardize the deliverable structure for traceability.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+
+## Directive Hierarchy
+
+| Directive | Meaning | Enforcement |
+|-----------|---------|-------------|
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Highest-priority command; never skip. | Blocks progress until satisfied. |
+| `[MUST]` | Mandatory task instructions. | Required before advancing. |
+| `[STRICT]` | Hard constraints or compliance rules. | Validated by audits. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Recommended practices. | Optional but encouraged. |【F:Reviewme.md†L64-L120】
+
+## Control Mechanisms
+
+1. **Role Assignment** – Specializes the AI behavior per protocol.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L110】
+2. **Sequential Steps** – Prevents reordering or skipping tasks.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+3. **Validation Checkpoints** – Include directives such as `**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit confirmation`.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+4. **Rule Loading** – Use `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` to fetch governance files before acting.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+5. **Unified Quality Audits** – Invoke `/review` or equivalent to trigger repository-wide checks.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】
+
+## Command & Integration Patterns
+
+* `@apply {template}` – Instantiate a template into the working document or checklist.
+* `/load {rule}` – Load rule files referenced by `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+* `/review` – Execute comprehensive quality audits before completion.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】
+
+Ensure protocols reference existing assets (e.g., `.cursor/dev-workflow`, `template-packs/`) and align with SecretFlow’s gates defined in `gates_config.yaml`.
+
+## Validation Requirements
+
+* Include at least one mid-protocol pause with **HALT** directives requiring human confirmation.
+* Document understanding vs. open questions to create an audit trail.【F:Reviewme.md†L240-L324】
+* Reference applicable rules via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` for each checklist block.
+
+## Template Authoring Guidelines
+
+* Number tasks (`1.0`, `1.1`, etc.) to support dependency mapping.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+* Embed directives inside checklist items to enforce compliance.
+* Provide domain-appropriate commentary inside blockquotes for context.
+
+## Output Standardization
+
+Final outputs must:
+
+1. Restate key metadata (project name, stakeholder roles, etc.).
+2. Summarize validated decisions and outstanding questions.
+3. Provide actionable task lists referencing templates for execution.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+
+Following this guide keeps newly authored protocols consistent with the governance framework analyzed from the Cursor conversation.

+# AI Protocol System Conversation Analysis
+
+## 1. Overview
+
+This report distills the 2,223-line Cursor conversation that reverse-engineered the AI Protocol System embedded in the SecretFlow workflows. The dialogue surfaces a governance-oriented prompting architecture that constrains AI behavior through role assignments, directive hierarchies, validation checkpoints, and reusable templates.【F:Reviewme.md†L1-L120】【F:Reviewme.md†L120-L240】
+
+## 2. Governance Framework Components
+
+### 2.1 Role-Based Personas
+
+* Dedicated personas (e.g., AI Codebase Analyst, Product Manager, Tech Lead, Senior Quality Engineer) enforce domain expertise per protocol.【F:Reviewme.md†L64-L110】
+* Each persona includes a mission statement that frames responsibilities and limits to scope.
+
+### 2.2 Directive Hierarchy
+
+* `[CRITICAL]` – highest priority, non-negotiable requirements.
+* `[MUST]` – mandatory operational steps the agent must execute.
+* `[STRICT]` – additional constraints reinforcing compliance.
+* `[GUIDELINE]` – best-practice advice that remains optional.【F:Reviewme.md†L64-L120】
+
+### 2.3 Sequential Execution Flow
+
+* Protocols enforce numbered steps or phases (STEP 1, STEP 2 …) to avoid skipping or reordering tasks.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+* Each step often maps to contextual discovery, planning, execution preparation, and validation.
+
+### 2.4 Validation Checkpoints
+
+* Mandatory halt directives (e.g., **HALT AND AWAIT**) pause execution until human confirmation arrives.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+* `/review` or equivalent commands trigger unified quality audits.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】
+
+### 2.5 Template System Architecture
+
+* Templates define reusable task scaffolding with `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` hooks that load rule files before acting.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+* Templates cover multiple domains (software delivery, process improvement, content creation) while retaining identical structure for traceability.
+
+### 2.6 Communication Standards
+
+* Normalized status markers such as `[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, and `[QUALITY GATE]` ensure predictable interaction flows.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】
+
+## 3. Protocol-Driven Collaboration Patterns
+
+1. **Context Bootstrapping** – Agents locate and load governing rules or assets before operating, ensuring alignment with project constraints.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L96】
+2. **Phase-Gated Progression** – Workflows segment into phases (e.g., discovery, planning, execution) with explicit exit criteria.【F:Reviewme.md†L240-L360】【F:Reviewme.md†L360-L480】
+3. **Template Application** – Agents select templates based on milestone type, guaranteeing consistent output formats.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+4. **Quality Integration** – Unified audits and validation questions are embedded throughout the protocol to maintain standards.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】【F:Reviewme.md†L360-L480】
+
+## 4. Client Workflow Development Insights
+
+* Client discovery emphasizes brand assets, audience mapping, and validation loops before building deliverables.【F:Reviewme.md†L240-L360】
+* Project execution protocols transform charters into milestone-based checklists with resource and dependency tracking.【F:Reviewme.md†L480-L560】
+* Data analysis planning requires phased questioning, detection of analysis type, and feasibility validation prior to computation.【F:Reviewme.md†L360-L480】
+
+## 5. SecretFlow Infrastructure Alignment
+
+* Workflow files rely on command patterns such as `@apply`, `/review`, and rule loaders, implying automation hooks inside the repository.
+* Quality gates integrate with centralized audit commands, suggesting compatibility with SecretFlow’s quality assurance tooling defined in `gates_config.yaml`.
+* Template and rule paths (e.g., `.cursor/dev-workflow/`) provide a filesystem-driven protocol registry the new examples must mirror.
+
+## 6. Best Practices Extracted
+
+1. Define explicit AI personas and mission statements.
+2. Enumerate directives with the `[CRITICAL]`/`[MUST]`/`[STRICT]`/`[GUIDELINE]` taxonomy.
+3. Use sequential phases with embedded confirmation checkpoints.
+4. Reference templates and rules through `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` markers for traceable compliance.
+5. Provide standardized final output templates to normalize deliverables across domains.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+
+## 7. Validation & Evidence Tracking
+
+* Every protocol incorporates explicit evidence capture (e.g., summarize understanding, list open questions) before completion.【F:Reviewme.md†L240-L324】
+* Checklists and milestone numbering supply auditable progress logs.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+
+The analyzed conversation showcases a rigorously structured AI Protocol System that scales across domains through persona specialization, directive enforcement, templated execution, and integrated quality gates. The subsequent example protocols and documentation inherit these characteristics to remain interoperable with SecretFlow’s governance ecosystem.

+# Integration Guide for AI Protocol Systems
+
+## Objective
+
+Ensure AI Protocol Systems interoperate with SecretFlow tooling, governance gates, and evidence tracking requirements derived from the analyzed conversation.【F:Reviewme.md†L1-L120】【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】
+
+## 1. Repository Alignment
+
+1. Store protocols under `ai-protocol-examples/` or `.cursor/dev-workflow/` to mirror existing structures.
+2. Reference rule files via `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-id}]`; map each `rule-id` to files in `template-packs/` or dedicated `rules/` directories.
+3. Maintain numbering consistency (`0-`, `1-`, etc.) for chronological execution compatibility.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+
+## 2. Command Patterns
+
+| Command | Purpose | Usage Context |
+|---------|---------|---------------|
+| `@apply {template}` | Instantiate predefined checklists into active plans. | During PHASE 3 synthesis.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】 |
+| `/load {rule}` | Import rule content referenced by `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`. | Before executing tasks with compliance requirements.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】 |
+| `/review` | Run comprehensive quality gates defined in `gates_config.yaml`. | Prior to protocol completion.【F:Reviewme.md†L84-L118】 |
+| `/handoff {protocol-id}` | (Optional) Pass context to downstream protocol or human reviewer. | After final validation checkpoints. |
+
+## 3. Validation Workflow
+
+1. **Environment Check** – Execute tooling validation commands referenced in `[STRICT]` directives.
+2. **Rule Loading** – `/load` each rule before applying relevant template steps.
+3. **Checkpoint Enforcement** – Honor `**HALT AND AWAIT**` statements; require explicit human confirmation to proceed.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】
+4. **Quality Audit** – Run `/review` and document remediation of CRITICAL/HIGH findings inside the protocol log.
+
+## 4. Evidence & Audit Trail
+
+* Capture understanding vs. questions tables to provide traceability.【F:Reviewme.md†L240-L324】
+* Use checklist numbering for progress tracking and dependency management.【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+* Record command outputs or validation results in linked audit notes or appendices.
+
+## 5. Integration with SecretFlow Quality Systems
+
+* Align final deliverables with QA workflows (e.g., `workflow/` scripts) to automate enforcement of `[CRITICAL]` and `[MUST]` directives.
+* Configure CI to ensure `/review` passes before merge, mirroring existing governance pipelines.
+
+## 6. Security & Access Controls
+
+* Enforce MFA for contributors and restrict repository access to required scopes only.
+* Prohibit storing secrets in protocol files; reference environment-based configuration instead.
+
+## 7. Deployment Checklist
+
+```markdown
+- [ ] Confirm protocol numbering and directory placement.
+- [ ] Validate all `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` references resolve to existing files.
+- [ ] Run `/review` on the updated workflow set.
+- [ ] Capture validation evidence and attach to QA records.
+- [ ] Communicate handoff instructions to downstream personas.
+```
+

+# PROTOCOL 2: PROJECT EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION
+
+## AI ROLE
+
+You are a **Project Execution Orchestrator & Delivery Steward**. Your mission is to convert approved project charters into actionable milestone roadmaps with embedded governance checkpoints and resource plans.【F:Reviewme.md†L480-L560】
+
+## INPUT
+
+- Project charter or PRD, including scope, constraints, and success metrics.
+- Stakeholder roster with decision rights and communication cadence expectations.
+- Reference to applicable delivery rules (e.g., `{coding-standards}`, `{change-management}`).
+
+## ALGORITHM
+
+### PHASE 1: Charter Assimilation
+
+**STEP 1.1 – Context & Rule Alignment**
+
+* **[CRITICAL]** `/load` every rule referenced in the charter via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` markers before modeling the plan.【F:Reviewme.md†L32-L84】【F:Reviewme.md†L520-L602】
+* **[MUST]** Validate scope boundaries, constraints, and success metrics with stakeholders; **AWAIT ANSWERS** for any ambiguous items.【F:Reviewme.md†L480-L560】
+
+**STEP 1.2 – Stakeholder Matrix Confirmation**
+
+* Document RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) mapping.
+* **HALT AND AWAIT** approval of the stakeholder matrix before proceeding.
+
+### PHASE 2: Milestone Architecture
+
+**STEP 2.1 – Workstream Decomposition**

+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+This guide documents the standardized AI Protocol System format distilled from the `Reviewme.md` conversation analysis. Use this reference when authoring new protocols to ensure alignment with the SecretFlow governance framework.
+
+## 1. Core Structure
+
+Every protocol **must** follow the sequence below:
+
+1. `# PROTOCOL {index}: {Name}`
+2. `## AI ROLE` (or `## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION` when bootstrapping)
+3. `## INPUT` (or equivalent context prerequisites section)
+4. `## {NAME} ALGORITHM`
+5. `## {NAME} TEMPLATES`
+6. `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`
+
+### Section Requirements
+
+- **AI ROLE:** Assign a specific persona and mission. Clarify deliverable style (e.g., "Your output should be structured plans, not prose").
+- **INPUT:** List mandatory context, documentation, or confirmations required before execution.
+- **ALGORITHM:** Organize into `PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3`, with numbered steps. Prepend each instruction with directive tags (`[CRITICAL]`, `[MUST]`, `[STRICT]`, `[GUIDELINE]`).
+- **TEMPLATES:** Provide domain templates using markdown checklists. Integrate rules via `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]`.
+- **FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE:** Supply a ready-to-use markdown deliverable referencing context, decisions, dependencies, and next steps.
+
+## 2. Directive Hierarchy
+
+| Directive | Description | Typical Usage |
+|-----------|-------------|----------------|
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Highest-priority instructions; must execute before any other action. | Environment validation, rule discovery, non-negotiable safety tasks. |
+| `[MUST]` | Mandatory actions required for correct completion. | Stakeholder interviews, template generation, plan synthesis. |
+| `[STRICT]` | Compliance-focused constraints. | Tool usage policies, format enforcement, data handling. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Recommended best practices. | Tone guidance, optimization suggestions, complexity management. |
+
+### Validation Markers
+
+- `HALT AND AWAIT`: Explicit pause. Wait for user confirmation before continuing.
+- `AWAIT ANSWERS`: Collect specified data points first.
+- `[QUALITY GATE]`: Trigger quality tooling such as `/review` and capture remediation steps.
+
+## 3. Template System Conventions
+
+- **Rule Binding:** Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` to dynamically attach governance documents.
+- **Checklist Syntax:** Leverage nested checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to express tasks and sub-tasks.
+- **Persona-Specific Templates:** Provide at least two domain templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement) that align with the AI role.
+
+## 4. Communication Patterns
+
+- Prefix major announcements with explicit speech (e.g., `> "I will now..."`).
+- Use standardized tags in conversation when appropriate (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+- Document assumptions with **My Understanding / My Questions** blocks prior to execution.
+
+## 5. Integration Expectations
+
+- Reference SecretFlow tooling where applicable (e.g., `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`).
+- Encourage evidence capture (logs, metrics, checklists) to support audit trails.
+- Align with repository structures such as `template-packs/`, `workflow/`, and gating configuration files.
+
+## 6. Validation & Quality Gates
+
+1. **Format Validation:** Ensure all sections exist and follow ordering rules.
+2. **Directive Coverage:** Confirm each phase contains at least one `[CRITICAL]` or `[MUST]` directive.
+3. **Integration Hooks:** Include `/review` or equivalent QA checkpoints.
+4. **User Confirmation:** Provide HALT points before high-impact actions.
+
+## 7. Usage Workflow
+
+1. Start from `templates/protocol-template.md` to scaffold a new protocol.
+2. Customize AI ROLE, INPUT, and PHASE instructions according to domain.
+3. Embed domain-specific templates with rule bindings.
+4. Update the final output block to match required deliverables.
+5. Validate using the checklist above before deploying the protocol.
+
+## 8. Additional Resources
+
+- `analysis-report.md` – Comprehensive breakdown of the conversation and governance mechanisms.
+- `integration-guide.md` – Instructions for connecting protocols with SecretFlow infrastructure.
+- Domain examples under `content-creation/`, `data-analysis/`, `project-management/`, and `client-workflow/` demonstrate practical applications of this format.

+# AI Protocol System Conversation Analysis
+
+## 1. Source Material Overview
+
+- **Conversation File:** `Reviewme.md`
+- **Length Reviewed:** 2,223 lines (Cursor export dated 10/02/2025 23:13:34 GMT+8)
+- **Primary Topics:** AI Protocol System structure, directive hierarchy, validation gates, role-based personas, workflow orchestration, SecretFlow infrastructure alignment.
+
+## 2. Governance & Control Architecture
+
+### 2.1 Directive Hierarchy
+
+| Directive | Purpose | Enforcement Pattern |
+|-----------|---------|---------------------|
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Non-negotiable safety or sequencing requirements. | Always executed first; frequently paired with "Before any other action" instructions. |
+| `[MUST]` | Mandatory operational actions. | Drive core workflow tasks (tooling discovery, stakeholder confirmation, template generation). |
+| `[STRICT]` | High-rigor rules that constrain execution style (environment validation, rule loading). | Often coupled with validation or compliance checks. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Best-practice guidance to keep outputs practical and human-aligned. | Provides flexibility without breaking compliance. |
+
+**Observation:** Directives precede each instruction to enforce deterministic behavior. They are frequently combined with communication verbs (ANNOUNCE, HALT, AWAIT) to force conversational checkpoints.
+
+### 2.2 Validation Checkpoints
+
+- **HALT AND AWAIT:** Forces the assistant to pause and request explicit confirmation before progressing.
+- **AWAIT ANSWERS:** Requires collecting missing context prior to continuing a phase.
+- **QUALITY GATE / `/review`:** Ensures a unified audit step before outputs are finalized.
+- **Go/No-Go Confirmations:** Embedded in later phases (e.g., milestone decomposition) to ensure stakeholder alignment.
+
+These checkpoints provide traceability and prevent premature execution, mimicking gated project management workflows.
+
+### 2.3 Role-Based Persona System
+
+- Personas such as **AI Codebase Analyst**, **Product Manager**, **Tech Lead**, **AI Paired Developer**, **Senior Quality Engineer**, and **Process Improvement Lead** were consistently assigned.
+- Each protocol binds the assistant to a specialized mission statement, constraining scope and vocabulary (e.g., "Your output should be structured plans, not prose").
+- Persona assignments often determine which toolsets and templates are activated.
+
+### 2.4 Template System
+
+- Protocols culminate in reusable templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement, Marketing Campaign).
+- Templates leverage `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` tokens to dynamically bind additional governance files.
+- Final output templates follow a standardized markdown report structure with checklists, dependency metadata, and justification narratives.
+
+## 3. Sequential Protocol Architecture
+
+### 3.1 Phase Structure
+
+- **PHASE 1:** Context acquisition, stakeholder interrogation, asset discovery.
+- **PHASE 2:** Analytical synthesis, plan construction, template selection.
+- **PHASE 3:** Validation, packaging, and hand-off including final communication steps.
+
+Each phase contains numbered steps with directive annotations. Steps frequently reference internal micro-templates (e.g., "AI Understanding" vs "Questions to User").
+
+### 3.2 Execution Flow Controls
+
+- Protocols enforce strict sequencing (`STEP 1`, `STEP 2`, …) paired with communications such as `ANNOUNCE`, `ACKNOWLEDGE`, `CONFIRM`.
+- Tool usage is bound by explicit instructions (e.g., discover directories via `find`, run `/review` before finalization).
+- Output is standardized via a "FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE" block to ensure compatibility with downstream systems.
+
+## 4. Client Workflow Development Insights
+
+- **Discovery Focus:** Emphasis on gathering business context, success metrics, constraints, and resource availability before any build activity.
+- **Integration Hooks:** Frequent references to `@apply`, `/load`, and other command macros to integrate with Cursor/SecretFlow tooling.
+- **Quality Assurance:** Dedicated protocols (e.g., Protocol 4) that execute audits, enforce `/review`, and capture evidence logs.
+- **Retrospective Loop:** Final protocol addresses continuous improvement, capturing learnings back into the template system.
+
+## 5. SecretFlow Infrastructure Alignment
+
+- Existing repository houses `/template-packs`, `/workflow`, `/ai-suggestion`, and gating configuration files, demonstrating a mature automation ecosystem.
+- Protocols rely on rule files and templates stored under `.cursor/dev-workflow/` and expect consistent directory naming for discovery.
+- The system anticipates integration with `gates_config.yaml` for automated QA and `/review` tooling, ensuring auditability.
+- Evidence tracking is achieved by embedding checklists and referencing rule sets within each template block.
+
+## 6. Best Practices Extracted
+
+1. **Enforce Persona Boundaries:** Start every protocol with a precise role definition and mission scope.
+2. **Front-Load Discovery:** Mandate context gathering before execution using `[CRITICAL]` and `[MUST]` prompts.
+3. **Standardize Communication:** Use canonical message tags (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+4. **Embed Validation:** Insert HALT points and `/review` commands prior to final outputs.
+5. **Leverage Templates:** Provide domain-specific checklists that call additional rule files through `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+6. **Document Final Output:** Supply a ready-to-use markdown package with sections for rationale, dependencies, and next steps.
+
+## 7. Implications for New Protocols
+
+- All new domain protocols must replicate the AI ROLE → INPUT → ALGORITHM → TEMPLATES → FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE sequence.
+- Directive hierarchy and validation gating should remain intact to maintain compliance with the governance framework.
+- Integration notes (SecretFlow tooling, `/review`, evidence capture) must be woven into execution phases.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+
+The analyzed conversation establishes an enterprise-grade AI Governance Framework that orchestrates assistant behavior through layered directives, gated execution, and standardized deliverables. The format is domain-agnostic yet rigid enough to ensure predictability, making it well-suited for extending SecretFlow's client-facing workflows and quality systems.

+# AI Protocol System Integration Guide
+
+This guide explains how to integrate the AI Protocol System format with the SecretFlow repository's tooling, quality gates, and evidence tracking mechanisms.
+
+## 1. Prerequisites
+
+- Familiarity with SecretFlow's development workflows (`/workflow`, `/template-packs`, `.cursor/dev-workflow/`).
+- Access to the unified `/review` command and gating configuration defined in `gates_config.yaml`.
+- Ability to run `@apply`, `/load`, and other Cursor macro commands referenced by existing protocols.
+
+## 2. Integration Workflow
+
+### Step 1: Protocol Registration
+
+1. Place new protocol files within the appropriate domain folder under `ai-protocol-examples/`.
+2. Update any higher-level orchestration documents (e.g., project bootstrap workflows) to reference the new protocol path.
+3. Annotate tasks with `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` tokens that correspond to rule files stored in `.cursor/dev-workflow/` or `template-packs/`.
+
+### Step 2: Rule & Template Loading
+
+- Use `/load {path}` to preload rule files before protocol execution.
+- Leverage `@apply templates/{template-name}` when templated content must be injected into the workspace.
+- Confirm all referenced rule names exist; missing rule files should be created under the SecretFlow template system.
+
+### Step 3: Tooling Commands
+
+| Purpose | Command Pattern | Notes |
+|---------|-----------------|-------|
+| Discover assets | ``find . -name "*{keyword}*" -type d`` | Often triggered by `[CRITICAL]` directives for environment scanning. |
+| Discover files | ``find . -name "*{keyword}*" -type f`` | Use during asset discovery when templates reference documentation. |
+| Run validation | `/review` | Required before finalizing deliverables; integrates with quality audit pipelines. |
+| Apply workflow snippets | `@apply workflows/{name}` | Reuses shared orchestration logic maintained in the repo. |
+
+### Step 4: Quality Gates
+
+1. Insert `[QUALITY GATE]` instructions within PHASE 3 of each protocol.
+2. Execute `/review` and capture results (pass/fail, remediation steps).
+3. Document outcomes in the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE under a dedicated "Quality Validation" section or checklist.
+
+### Step 5: Evidence Tracking
+
+- Maintain audit trails by referencing:
+  - Log outputs from `/review` runs.
+  - Checklists completed within protocol templates.
+  - Linked artifacts (design docs, charters, datasets) stored in repository directories.
+- Encourage assistants to state "Evidence captured:" followed by bullet lists of files, commands, or metrics.
+
+## 3. Integration with Client Workflows
+
+- Align client-facing protocols with `client-workflow/` directory structure for easy onboarding.
+- Ensure HALT checkpoints map to client approval stages (e.g., discovery validation, plan sign-off).
+- Provide instructions for syncing deliverables with client collaboration tools (e.g., exporting markdown to project trackers).
+
+## 4. Continuous Improvement Loop
+
+1. After executing a protocol, log retrospectives in `workflow/implementation-retrospective` equivalents.
+2. Update rule files and templates based on lessons learned.
+3. Version protocol files with semantic tags (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) to track changes.
+
+## 5. Compliance & Security Notes
+
+- Follow MFA and credential management best practices outlined in repository policies.
+- Operate in read-only mode during analysis; switch to agent mode only for approved edits.
+- Avoid embedding secrets in prompts; rely on environment configuration files.
+- Require human review before merging any protocol changes into production branches.
+
+## 6. Validation Checklist
+
+- [ ] Protocol stored in correct directory.
+- [ ] All referenced rule files exist and are accessible via `/load`.
+- [ ] `/review` executed and results documented.
+- [ ] HALT checkpoints aligned with stakeholder approvals.
+- [ ] Evidence trail recorded in final deliverable.
+
+Following this guide will ensure new AI Protocol Systems integrate seamlessly with SecretFlow's governance tooling and maintain the quality standards defined in the original conversation.

+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+This guide documents the standardized AI Protocol System format extracted from `Reviewme.md` and aligned with SecretFlow governance practices.
+
+## 1. Core Principles
+- **Role-Driven Execution:** Every protocol defines a specialized AI persona and mission to constrain behavior.
+- **Directive Hierarchy:** `[CRITICAL]` → `[MUST]` → `[STRICT]` → `[GUIDELINE]` control compliance priority.
+- **Sequential Phases:** Algorithms are broken into ordered phases (`PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3+`) with numbered actions.
+- **Validation Gates:** Mandatory pauses ensure human confirmation before advancing to risky steps.
+- **Template Orchestration:** Reusable task templates accelerate consistent delivery and embed rule packs via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+
+## 2. Protocol Layout
+```markdown
+# PROTOCOL {index}: {Title}
+
+## AI ROLE
+{Persona description and mission}
+
+## INPUT
+- Required documents, repositories, or environmental context
+- Preconditions or linked rule files
+
+## ALGORITHM
+### PHASE 1: {Name}
+1. **`[CRITICAL]` {Action}** – Non-negotiable step executed before anything else.
+2. **`[MUST]` {Action}** – Mandatory tasks that can follow once CRITICAL items are satisfied.
+3. **`[STRICT]` {Action}** – Hard requirements with allowed contingencies.
+4. **`[GUIDELINE]` {Action}** – Best practices to improve quality without blocking progress.
+
+### PHASE 2: {Name}
+...repeat structure...
+
+### PHASE 3: {Name}
+...repeat structure and embed **HALT AND AWAIT** checkpoints where needed...
+
+## TEMPLATES
+### Template A: {Use Case}
+```markdown
+- [ ] {Task} [APPLIES RULES: {rule-pack}]
+  - [ ] {Sub-task}
+```
+
+### Template B: {Use Case}
+...
+
+## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE
+```markdown
+# {Deliverable Title}
+
+## Section 1
+- **Metadata:** [...]
+
+## Section 2
+- Checklist / evidence capture
+```
+```
+
+## 3. Directive Hierarchy Details
+| Directive | Description | Enforcement |
+| --- | --- | --- |
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Highest-priority guardrails that must run before any other operation. | Hard stop if unmet. |
+| `[MUST]` | Required tasks ensuring completeness or safety. | Failing to execute invalidates protocol. |
+| `[STRICT]` | Rigid requirements often tied to compliance rules. | Deviation requires documented approval. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Recommended optimizations or quality enhancers. | Optional but encouraged. |
+
+## 4. Validation Checkpoints
+- **HALT Statements:** “**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit user confirmation” ensures synchronization.
+- **Clarification Prompts:** “**AWAIT ANSWERS** before proceeding” harvests missing context.
+- **Quality Announcements:** `[QUALITY GATE]` messages prepare stakeholders for audits.
+
+## 5. Template System Integration
+- **Rule Binding:** Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` to load governance packs (e.g., coding standards, testing protocols).
+- **Command Hooks:** Support `@apply {template}` and `/load {rule-pack}` for automation compatibility.
+- **Evidence Logging:** Templates request success criteria, dependencies, and validation notes for audit trails.
+
+## 6. Usage Workflow
+1. **Select Protocol:** Choose the domain file (content, data, project, client).
+2. **Load Rules:** Execute any referenced rule files before starting (`/load rules/{pack}.md`).
+3. **Follow Phases Sequentially:** Do not reorder phases; obey directive hierarchy.
+4. **Respect Checkpoints:** Pause whenever the protocol instructs; capture user approvals.
+5. **Produce Final Output:** Populate the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE and link supporting evidence.
+
+## 7. Extending the System
+- Start from `templates/protocol-template.md`.
+- Define new personas consistent with SecretFlow roles.
+- Align directives with repository security and quality policies.
+- Register new rule packs or templates in the Template Library for discoverability.
+
+## 8. References
+- Detailed conversation analysis: `analysis-report.md`.
+- Domain-specific protocols: see subdirectories under `ai-protocol-examples/`.
+
+Adhering to this guide ensures every AI workflow remains auditable, predictable, and aligned with SecretFlow’s governance expectations.

+   - Specialized assignments (e.g., AI Codebase Analyst, Product Manager, Tech Lead) define scope, tone, and allowable tooling before execution.【F:Reviewme.md†L28-L75】
+   - Personas enforce contextual expertise and prevent generic assistant responses.
+2. **Directive Hierarchy**
+   - Priority ladder: `[CRITICAL]` → `[MUST]` → `[STRICT]` → `[GUIDELINE]` governs compliance, sequencing, and escalation.【F:Reviewme.md†L60-L75】
+   - Directives apply to tool usage, environment validation, and collaboration checkpoints.
+3. **Sequential Execution Flow**
+   - Protocols require numbered steps (`STEP 1`, `STEP 2`, …) and multi-phase algorithms that prohibit reordering.【F:Reviewme.md†L82-L104】
+   - Each step declares objective, actions, and confirmation requirements.
+4. **Validation Checkpoints**
+   - Mandatory halt statements (e.g., “**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit user confirmation”) form embedded quality gates.【F:Reviewme.md†L105-L126】
+   - Checkpoints synchronize AI actions with human oversight.
+5. **Template System Architecture**
+   - Protocols link to reusable task templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement) invoked via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags for compliance automation.【F:Reviewme.md†L400-L474】
+6. **Quality Assurance Integration**
+   - Built-in audit commands (`/review`, quality gate announcements) standardize verification before completion.【F:Reviewme.md†L118-L123】
+
+## 3. Protocol-Driven Collaboration Patterns
+| Pattern | Description | Effect |
+| --- | --- | --- |
+| **Mission Framing** | AI ROLE + mission statements tailor reasoning modes. | Aligns assistant mindset with domain goals.【F:Reviewme.md†L37-L54】 |
+| **Tooling Activation** | Initial directives discover tooling, load rules, and confirm environment readiness. | Ensures safe, reproducible execution.【F:Reviewme.md†L55-L80】 |
+| **Context Acquisition** | `[CRITICAL]` instructions to read rule files and project artifacts. | Prevents hallucinations and enforces evidence-driven outputs.【F:Reviewme.md†L107-L114】 |
+| **Communication Standards** | Required status callouts (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`). | Creates audit trail and cross-agent interoperability.【F:Reviewme.md†L115-L117】 |
+
+## 4. Template & Format Patterns
+- **Canonical Sections:** `# PROTOCOL {n}`, `## AI ROLE`, `## INPUT`, `## ALGORITHM` (with PHASE 1..n), `## TEMPLATES`, `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`.
+- **Phase Design:** Each phase decomposes into enumerated steps with directive prefixes, environment commands, and validation halts.
+- **Rule Binding:** `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` anchors downstream work to governance packs.
+- **Final Output:** Standardized markdown deliverables with checklists, metadata, and evidence fields.【F:Reviewme.md†L430-L474】
+
+## 5. Client Workflow Development Insights
+1. **Bootstrap Analysis:** Protocols begin with discovery—asset detection, stakeholder mapping, charter parsing—to ground subsequent automation.【F:Reviewme.md†L201-L275】【F:Reviewme.md†L430-L474】
+2. **User Collaboration:** Continuous validations (strategy confirmation, “reply ‘Go’”) embed human approval loops.【F:Reviewme.md†L236-L268】【F:Reviewme.md†L452-L462】
+3. **Evidence Tracking:** Templates prompt for success criteria, dependencies, and audit items, aligning with quality audit requirements.
+4. **Infrastructure Alignment:** Protocols reference filesystem inspections (`find . -name ...`), rule loading, and command invocations consistent with SecretFlow tooling expectations.【F:Reviewme.md†L213-L229】
+
+## 6. Integration Patterns with SecretFlow
+- **Command Syntax:** Encourages `@apply`, `/review`, and rule loading to sync with repository automation hooks.
+- **Quality Gates:** Mirrors SecretFlow’s quality audit files (`gates_config.yaml`) by embedding validation before status transitions.
+- **Template Compatibility:** Supports dynamic generation of execution files (`execution-[project].md`) aligning with repository structure conventions.【F:Reviewme.md†L440-L474】
+
+## 7. Best Practices Identified
+1. **Enforce Directive Hierarchy** to maintain deterministic behavior.
+2. **Use Phase Gates** to modularize reasoning and allow multi-agent handoffs.
+3. **Embed Validation Questions** to capture missing context before action.
+4. **Provide Reusable Templates** to standardize outputs across domains.
+5. **Document Communication Standards** to ensure interoperability across AI agents and human reviewers.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+The conversation demonstrates a robust AI Protocol System that governs agent behavior through layered directives, sequential workflows, and reusable templates. Applying these structures across new domains yields predictable, auditable outcomes that integrate seamlessly with SecretFlow’s governance and quality frameworks.

+# AI Protocol System Integration Guide
+
+This guide explains how to operationalize the AI Protocol System within the SecretFlow repository and broader delivery ecosystem.
+
+## 1. Prerequisites
+- **Access Controls:** Enable MFA on all contributor accounts and limit tokens to required repos.
+- **Execution Modes:** Use Read-Only mode for reconnaissance; switch to Agent mode only for approved edits.
+- **Toolchain:** Ensure `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`, and repository-specific scripts are available in the workspace.
+
+## 2. Integration Workflow
+### STEP 1 – Load Governance Packs
+1. Run `/load rules/{pack}.md` for each `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` directive referenced in the protocol.
+2. Confirm successful loading using `[TASK STATUS] Rules {pack} loaded` message.
+
+### STEP 2 – Initialize Protocol Execution
+1. Open the appropriate protocol file (e.g., `content-creation/0-content-strategy-bootstrap.md`).
+2. Provide the required INPUT context (charter, datasets, stakeholder roster) to the assigned AI persona.
+3. Trigger automation via `@apply protocol {file-path}` when using compatible orchestration tools.
+
+### STEP 3 – Enforce Validation Gates
+1. Respect all `HALT AND AWAIT` statements; record user approvals in meeting notes or ticket comments.
+2. Use `/review` or repository audit scripts after each phase marked `[QUALITY GATE]`.
+3. Document responses to clarification prompts directly in the protocol output.
+
+### STEP 4 – Generate Deliverables
+1. Populate the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE with collected evidence, metrics, and links.
+2. Attach artifacts (dashboards, PRs, notebooks) referenced in the deliverable to maintain traceability.
+3. Submit outputs through existing workflow tools (e.g., GitHub PR, SecretFlow Workboard).
+
+## 3. Quality Assurance Alignment
+- **Audit Hooks:** Align protocol checkpoints with `gates_config.yaml` to ensure automated QA parity.
+- **Testing Commands:** For engineering tasks, run `pytest`, `ruff`, or project-specific linters before marking tasks complete.
+- **Evidence Logging:** Store validation results in protocol output or linked audit files for compliance reviews.
+
+## 4. Command Patterns
+| Command | Purpose |
+| --- | --- |
+| `@apply protocol {file}` | Load and execute protocol via automation framework. |
+| `/load rules/{pack}.md` | Pull rule definitions into the session memory. |
+| `/review` | Trigger comprehensive quality audit across deliverables. |
+| `@status {message}` | Broadcast checkpoint updates to collaborators. |
+
+## 5. Integration with SecretFlow Assets
+- **Templates:** Store reusable templates under `template-packs/` and reference them using `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+- **Scripts:** Leverage `scripts/` utilities for data pulls, environment checks, and deployment previews.
+- **Documentation:** Update `docs/` or workflow knowledge bases with protocol outcomes for institutional learning.
+
+## 6. Governance and Security
+- Capture approvals for deviations from `[STRICT]` requirements in change control logs.
+- Avoid embedding secrets; rely on environment configurations or Vault-managed variables.
+- Require human review before merging changes generated through protocol executions.
+
+## 7. Continuous Improvement
+- Feed retrospective insights into protocol updates via `workflow/5-implementation-retrospective.md` or equivalent processes.
+- Version templates and rule packs to track evolution and support rollback if regressions occur.
+
+Following this integration workflow ensures AI Protocol Systems operate reliably within SecretFlow’s security, quality, and collaboration standards.

+This guide distills the governance patterns documented in `Reviewme.md` into a reusable reference for designing, validating, and extending AI Protocol Systems across domains.
+
+## Directive Hierarchy
+- **`[CRITICAL]`** – Highest priority directives. These must execute before any other action and often include rule discovery, environment validation, or human confirmation requirements.
+- **`[MUST]`** – Mandatory steps that define the core workflow. Skipping or altering them breaks protocol compliance.
+- **`[STRICT]`** – Enforced constraints or quality expectations (e.g., validation checks, evidence capture) that limit how steps are performed.
+- **`[GUIDELINE]`** – Recommended practices that provide flexibility while preserving consistency.
+
+## Standard Protocol Layout
+Each protocol must follow the exact heading order below:
+
+1. `# PROTOCOL {Number}: {Name}`
+2. `## AI ROLE`
+   - Persona definition, mission scope, and deliverable expectations
+   - Optional emphasis (e.g., “Your output should be structured tables, not prose.”)
+3. `## INPUT`
+   - Bullet list of required context, artifacts, and preconditions
+4. Horizontal rule `---`
+5. `## {NAME} ALGORITHM`
+   - `### PHASE 1: {Title}` with numbered steps and directive tags
+   - `### PHASE 2: {Title}`
+   - `### PHASE 3: {Title}` (add `PHASE 4+` if required)
+   - Explicit halt points (`**HALT AND AWAIT**`) where human confirmation is mandatory
+6. `## {NAME} TEMPLATES`
+   - Domain-specific checklists, forms, or matrices with `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags
+7. `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`
+   - Markdown code block that standardizes the deliverable layout
+
+## Execution Flow Patterns
+- **Phase Ordering:** Phases are executed sequentially; each phase may include numbered steps, sub-steps, and communication scripts.
+- **Validation Checkpoints:** Insert pause points after major analysis or planning steps. The assistant must wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
+- **Command Syntax:** Reference repository tooling with `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`, or equivalent commands to maintain interoperability.
+- **Evidence Tracking:** Capture analysis notes, decisions, risks, and approvals within the templates or final output sections.
+
+## Template Integration Rules
+- Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-pack}]` to invoke rule files or governance packs.
+- Provide internal template variations (e.g., Template A, Template B) for different scenario types inside the same protocol.
+- Maintain markdown checklist formatting for tasks (`- [ ]`), nested sub-tasks, and metadata annotations (complexity, dependencies, resources).
+
+## Communication Standards
+- Begin major transitions with explicit announcements (e.g., “I will now generate the execution milestones…”).
+- Use standardized labels (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`) in collaborative contexts.
+- Document understanding vs. open questions in structured blocks before seeking approval.
+
+## Quality & Safety Considerations
+- Run validation commands (`/review`, linting, tests) when specified.
+- Highlight risks, mitigation strategies, and outstanding assumptions before completion.
+- Ensure human approvals are logged prior to moving past critical phases.
+
+## Extending the System
+- Reuse the protocol template (see `templates/protocol-template.md`) when creating new domain workflows.
+- Align new files with SecretFlow automation by preserving command syntax, directory naming conventions, and evidence capture patterns.
+- Cross-link related protocols to support multi-phase engagements (e.g., discovery → execution → retrospective).
+
+By following this reference, teams can craft new protocols that remain compliant with the governance model demonstrated in the conversation while adapting content to any operational domain.

+# AI Protocol System Conversation Analysis
+
+## 1. Executive Summary
+- The reviewed conversation in `Reviewme.md` documents how structured **AI Protocol Systems** enforce consistent assistant behavior through role assignment, directive hierarchies, phased execution, validation gates, and reusable templates.
+- Every protocol follows a deterministic layout (`AI ROLE`, `INPUT`, `ALGORITHM`, `TEMPLATES`, `FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`) that keeps multi-agent collaboration aligned with governance expectations.
+- Client workflow development extends the same format to professional services by integrating infrastructure scans, template reuse, and quality gates from the SecretFlow repository.
+
+## 2. Governance Framework Components
+- **Role-Based Personas:** Explicit personas (e.g., AI Codebase Analyst, Product Manager, Tech Lead, Project Manager) define mission scope, communication tone, and deliverable types before any action begins.
+- **Directive Hierarchy:** Prefixes such as `[CRITICAL]`, `[MUST]`, `[STRICT]`, and `[GUIDELINE]` establish non-negotiable behavior controls, sequencing rules, and guardrails for AI discretion.
+- **Sequential Execution:** Protocols enforce numbered phases (`PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3`) with granular steps, sub-steps, and dependency callouts that prevent the assistant from skipping essential work.
+- **Validation Gates:** Mandatory pauses (`HALT AND AWAIT`, explicit confirmation prompts) ensure human-in-the-loop approvals at analysis, planning, and delivery checkpoints.
+- **Template System:** Embedded markdown templates (task checklists, decision matrices, content frameworks) standardize outputs while referencing `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` for rule injection.
+
+## 3. Control Mechanisms & Effectiveness
+- **Context Loading Requirements:** `[CRITICAL]` directives require scanning rule files and contextual resources before execution, guaranteeing configuration alignment.
+- **Tool Usage Protocols:** Instructions explicitly bind terminal commands, file edits, and automation usage to approved patterns (`@apply`, `/load`, `/review`), reducing operational variance.
+- **Communication Standards:** Labeled status updates (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`) maintain audit trails and facilitate team coordination.
+- **Quality Integration:** Unified review commands, risk callouts, and evidence capture embed quality assurance into each protocol phase.
+
+## 4. Client Workflow Development Insights
+- **Infrastructure Analysis First:** The conversation emphasizes scanning `scripts/`, `project_generator/`, `workflow/`, `.cursor/dev-workflow/`, and related directories before authoring client workflows to leverage existing assets.
+- **Six-Protocol Structure:** Client engagements mirror the development workflow lifecycle (discovery → PRD → tasks → execution → quality → retrospective) while preserving format parity.
+- **Integration Priorities:** New client protocols must reuse command syntax, validation checkpoints, and rule application patterns to remain interoperable with existing quality audits and automation scripts.
+- **Success Metrics & Risk Controls:** Enhanced prompts include measurable KPIs, risk considerations, and client-type variations to support professional-grade service delivery.
+
+## 5. Format Patterns & Reuse Strategy
+- **Mandatory Sections:** Each protocol renders the same sequence of sections with consistent heading levels and markdown blocks to enable deterministic parsing.
+- **Phased Algorithms:** Phases are named, ordered, and annotated with directives; each contains explicit actions, communications, and halt conditions.
+- **Template Application:** Domain-specific templates (content calendars, analytical decision matrices, milestone breakdowns) are embedded within the protocol to standardize execution outputs.
+- **Final Output Standards:** The `FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE` provides a ready-to-fill structure, guaranteeing that deliverables remain consistent across personas and domains.
+
+## 6. Best Practices Derived from Conversation
+- Begin with environment validation and rule discovery before acting on user tasks.
+- Maintain human approval loops at critical decision points to uphold governance.
+- Reference rule packs via `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` to ensure cross-protocol consistency.
+- Document assumptions, outstanding questions, and risk mitigations inside standardized communication blocks.
+- Align outputs with quality audits by invoking `/review` or equivalent checks prior to completion announcements.
+
+## 7. Integration Recommendations for SecretFlow
+- Map new protocols into `.cursor/dev-workflow/` or parallel directories while inheriting shared templates for governance compliance.
+- Utilize repository automation (scripts, workflow templates) for enforcement of command syntax and validation gates.
+- Track evidence artifacts (analysis notes, decision matrices, audit logs) within version-controlled markdown to support traceability and retrospectives.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+The conversation establishes a reusable, domain-agnostic AI Protocol System blueprint centered on role clarity, directive enforcement, procedural rigor, and quality integration. The accompanying examples in this repository extend those patterns to content strategy, data analysis planning, project orchestration, and client engagement while preserving interoperability with SecretFlow infrastructure.

+# Integration Guide for AI Protocol Systems
+
+This guide explains how to integrate new AI Protocol System files with the existing SecretFlow infrastructure, ensuring command compatibility, auditability, and operational safety.
+
+## 1. Repository Alignment
+- **Directory Placement:** Store domain protocols alongside existing workflows (e.g., `.cursor/dev-workflow/`) or in sibling folders. Maintain numbering prefixes (`0-`, `1-`, `2-`) for ordered execution.
+- **Version Control:** Commit each protocol change with descriptive messages and run `/review` or the project’s CI commands before submitting pull requests.
+- **Evidence Storage:** Keep analysis notes, audit logs, and decision artifacts in markdown within the same protocol directory for traceability.
+
+## 2. Command Patterns
+- `@apply <template-name>` – Load reusable snippet packs or templates referenced in `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` blocks.
+- `/load <path>` – Import rule files, configuration manifests, or context packages required by `[CRITICAL]` discovery steps.
+- `/review` – Trigger unified quality audits after major deliverables or before closing a task.
+- `make test` / `pytest` / `npm test` – Execute domain-specific automated tests when protocols instruct validation via `[STRICT]` directives.
+
+## 3. Validation Workflow
+1. **Rule Discovery:** `[CRITICAL]` steps often mandate scanning rule packs before acting. Use `/load` or repository tooling to gather the necessary context.
+2. **Execution Tracking:** Log progress with standardized communication tags (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+3. **Quality Gates:** Invoke `/review` or equivalent scripts whenever templates call for a quality audit. Document results in the final output.
+4. **Human Confirmation:** Honor `**HALT AND AWAIT**` checkpoints by pausing for explicit approval within collaborative platforms.
+
+## 4. Template System Integration
+- Reference existing templates under `workflow/templates/` or `template-packs/`. When introducing new templates, follow the same markdown checklist style and embed `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]` tags to connect with governance rules.
+- Use `templates/protocol-template.md` as the scaffolding for additional protocols to ensure consistent headings and directive usage.
+
+## 5. Quality & Security Requirements
+- **Security Defaults:** Never embed secrets directly. Use environment variables or vault integrations referenced by the repository.
+- **MFA & Access Controls:** Align with organizational security policies by enabling MFA on connected services and limiting token scopes.
+- **Testing & Linting:** Execute mandated tests or linters when protocols specify `[STRICT]` validation actions. Record command output within quality sections of the final report.
+- **Peer Review:** All protocol updates should undergo human review prior to merging, reflecting the governance emphasis on oversight.
+
+## 6. Integration Checklist
+- [ ] Confirm directory placement and naming conventions follow the numbering schema.
+- [ ] Verify `[CRITICAL]` steps reference actual rule files or templates available in the repository.
+- [ ] Ensure command examples match existing tooling (`@apply`, `/load`, `/review`).
+- [ ] Add validation checkpoints with clear pause instructions.
+- [ ] Update cross-references (e.g., pointing to follow-on protocols) when expanding multi-phase workflows.
+
+Following this guide guarantees that new AI Protocol Systems remain interoperable with SecretFlow automation, enforceable by governance controls, and auditable for quality compliance.

+### PHASE 1: Stakeholder & Resource Activation
+1. **`[CRITICAL]` Stakeholder Map Confirmation:** `/load project-governance.md` and compile RACI details in `execution/{project}-stakeholders.md`.
+2. **`[MUST]` Resource Availability Check:** Verify allocation, bandwidth, and skill alignment. Record conflicts and escalate via `[APPLIES RULES: {resource-management}]`.
+3. **`[STRICT]` Tooling Readiness Audit:** Ensure CI/CD pipelines, repositories, and collaboration tools are accessible. Document gaps with mitigation owners.
+
+### PHASE 2: Milestone Blueprinting & Validation
+1. **`[MUST]` Milestone Generation:** Break scope into milestones with WHY statements, success criteria, and dependency mapping.
+2. **`[MUST]` Risk Embedding:** For each milestone, tag high/medium/low risk and link to `risk-register.md` entries.
+3. **Communication:** Announce: “Execution milestones prepared with dependencies and risks. Awaiting go/no-go.”
+4. **Validation:** `**HALT AND AWAIT** explicit approval before expanding into task-level detail.`
+
+### PHASE 3: Task Decomposition & Quality Integration
+1. **`[MUST]` Template Application:** Apply scenario-specific templates (Software Development, Process Improvement, Marketing Campaign) to each milestone.
+2. **`[STRICT]` Quality Gate Planning:** Schedule `/review project` or equivalent audits at the end of critical tasks.
+3. **`[GUIDELINE]` Parallelization Analysis:** Highlight opportunities for concurrent work without increasing risk.
+4. **Completion Gate:** Update `execution/{project}-plan.md`, run `/review execution-plan`, and await stakeholder acknowledgment before kickoff.
