+# AI Protocol System Format Reference Guide
+
+This guide documents the standardized AI Protocol System format distilled from the `Reviewme.md` conversation analysis. Use this reference when authoring new protocols to ensure alignment with the SecretFlow governance framework.
+
+## 1. Core Structure
+
+Every protocol **must** follow the sequence below:
+
+1. `# PROTOCOL {index}: {Name}`
+2. `## AI ROLE` (or `## 1. AI ROLE AND MISSION` when bootstrapping)
+3. `## INPUT` (or equivalent context prerequisites section)
+4. `## {NAME} ALGORITHM`
+5. `## {NAME} TEMPLATES`
+6. `## FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE`
+
+### Section Requirements
+
+- **AI ROLE:** Assign a specific persona and mission. Clarify deliverable style (e.g., "Your output should be structured plans, not prose").
+- **INPUT:** List mandatory context, documentation, or confirmations required before execution.
+- **ALGORITHM:** Organize into `PHASE 1`, `PHASE 2`, `PHASE 3`, with numbered steps. Prepend each instruction with directive tags (`[CRITICAL]`, `[MUST]`, `[STRICT]`, `[GUIDELINE]`).
+- **TEMPLATES:** Provide domain templates using markdown checklists. Integrate rules via `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]`.
+- **FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE:** Supply a ready-to-use markdown deliverable referencing context, decisions, dependencies, and next steps.
+
+## 2. Directive Hierarchy
+
+| Directive | Description | Typical Usage |
+|-----------|-------------|----------------|
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Highest-priority instructions; must execute before any other action. | Environment validation, rule discovery, non-negotiable safety tasks. |
+| `[MUST]` | Mandatory actions required for correct completion. | Stakeholder interviews, template generation, plan synthesis. |
+| `[STRICT]` | Compliance-focused constraints. | Tool usage policies, format enforcement, data handling. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Recommended best practices. | Tone guidance, optimization suggestions, complexity management. |
+
+### Validation Markers
+
+- `HALT AND AWAIT`: Explicit pause. Wait for user confirmation before continuing.
+- `AWAIT ANSWERS`: Collect specified data points first.
+- `[QUALITY GATE]`: Trigger quality tooling such as `/review` and capture remediation steps.
+
+## 3. Template System Conventions
+
+- **Rule Binding:** Use `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` to dynamically attach governance documents.
+- **Checklist Syntax:** Leverage nested checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to express tasks and sub-tasks.
+- **Persona-Specific Templates:** Provide at least two domain templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement) that align with the AI role.
+
+## 4. Communication Patterns
+
+- Prefix major announcements with explicit speech (e.g., `> "I will now..."`).
+- Use standardized tags in conversation when appropriate (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+- Document assumptions with **My Understanding / My Questions** blocks prior to execution.
+
+## 5. Integration Expectations
+
+- Reference SecretFlow tooling where applicable (e.g., `@apply`, `/load`, `/review`).
+- Encourage evidence capture (logs, metrics, checklists) to support audit trails.
+- Align with repository structures such as `template-packs/`, `workflow/`, and gating configuration files.
+
+## 6. Validation & Quality Gates
+
+1. **Format Validation:** Ensure all sections exist and follow ordering rules.
+2. **Directive Coverage:** Confirm each phase contains at least one `[CRITICAL]` or `[MUST]` directive.
+3. **Integration Hooks:** Include `/review` or equivalent QA checkpoints.
+4. **User Confirmation:** Provide HALT points before high-impact actions.
+
+## 7. Usage Workflow
+
+1. Start from `templates/protocol-template.md` to scaffold a new protocol.
+2. Customize AI ROLE, INPUT, and PHASE instructions according to domain.
+3. Embed domain-specific templates with rule bindings.
+4. Update the final output block to match required deliverables.
+5. Validate using the checklist above before deploying the protocol.
+
+## 8. Additional Resources
+
+- `analysis-report.md` – Comprehensive breakdown of the conversation and governance mechanisms.
+- `integration-guide.md` – Instructions for connecting protocols with SecretFlow infrastructure.
+- Domain examples under `content-creation/`, `data-analysis/`, `project-management/`, and `client-workflow/` demonstrate practical applications of this format.

+# AI Protocol System Conversation Analysis
+
+## 1. Source Material Overview
+
+- **Conversation File:** `Reviewme.md`
+- **Length Reviewed:** 2,223 lines (Cursor export dated 10/02/2025 23:13:34 GMT+8)
+- **Primary Topics:** AI Protocol System structure, directive hierarchy, validation gates, role-based personas, workflow orchestration, SecretFlow infrastructure alignment.
+
+## 2. Governance & Control Architecture
+
+### 2.1 Directive Hierarchy
+
+| Directive | Purpose | Enforcement Pattern |
+|-----------|---------|---------------------|
+| `[CRITICAL]` | Non-negotiable safety or sequencing requirements. | Always executed first; frequently paired with "Before any other action" instructions. |
+| `[MUST]` | Mandatory operational actions. | Drive core workflow tasks (tooling discovery, stakeholder confirmation, template generation). |
+| `[STRICT]` | High-rigor rules that constrain execution style (environment validation, rule loading). | Often coupled with validation or compliance checks. |
+| `[GUIDELINE]` | Best-practice guidance to keep outputs practical and human-aligned. | Provides flexibility without breaking compliance. |
+
+**Observation:** Directives precede each instruction to enforce deterministic behavior. They are frequently combined with communication verbs (ANNOUNCE, HALT, AWAIT) to force conversational checkpoints.
+
+### 2.2 Validation Checkpoints
+
+- **HALT AND AWAIT:** Forces the assistant to pause and request explicit confirmation before progressing.
+- **AWAIT ANSWERS:** Requires collecting missing context prior to continuing a phase.
+- **QUALITY GATE / `/review`:** Ensures a unified audit step before outputs are finalized.
+- **Go/No-Go Confirmations:** Embedded in later phases (e.g., milestone decomposition) to ensure stakeholder alignment.
+
+These checkpoints provide traceability and prevent premature execution, mimicking gated project management workflows.
+
+### 2.3 Role-Based Persona System
+
+- Personas such as **AI Codebase Analyst**, **Product Manager**, **Tech Lead**, **AI Paired Developer**, **Senior Quality Engineer**, and **Process Improvement Lead** were consistently assigned.
+- Each protocol binds the assistant to a specialized mission statement, constraining scope and vocabulary (e.g., "Your output should be structured plans, not prose").
+- Persona assignments often determine which toolsets and templates are activated.
+
+### 2.4 Template System
+
+- Protocols culminate in reusable templates (e.g., Software Development, Process Improvement, Marketing Campaign).
+- Templates leverage `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` tokens to dynamically bind additional governance files.
+- Final output templates follow a standardized markdown report structure with checklists, dependency metadata, and justification narratives.
+
+## 3. Sequential Protocol Architecture
+
+### 3.1 Phase Structure
+
+- **PHASE 1:** Context acquisition, stakeholder interrogation, asset discovery.
+- **PHASE 2:** Analytical synthesis, plan construction, template selection.
+- **PHASE 3:** Validation, packaging, and hand-off including final communication steps.
+
+Each phase contains numbered steps with directive annotations. Steps frequently reference internal micro-templates (e.g., "AI Understanding" vs "Questions to User").
+
+### 3.2 Execution Flow Controls
+
+- Protocols enforce strict sequencing (`STEP 1`, `STEP 2`, …) paired with communications such as `ANNOUNCE`, `ACKNOWLEDGE`, `CONFIRM`.
+- Tool usage is bound by explicit instructions (e.g., discover directories via `find`, run `/review` before finalization).
+- Output is standardized via a "FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE" block to ensure compatibility with downstream systems.
+
+## 4. Client Workflow Development Insights
+
+- **Discovery Focus:** Emphasis on gathering business context, success metrics, constraints, and resource availability before any build activity.
+- **Integration Hooks:** Frequent references to `@apply`, `/load`, and other command macros to integrate with Cursor/SecretFlow tooling.
+- **Quality Assurance:** Dedicated protocols (e.g., Protocol 4) that execute audits, enforce `/review`, and capture evidence logs.
+- **Retrospective Loop:** Final protocol addresses continuous improvement, capturing learnings back into the template system.
+
+## 5. SecretFlow Infrastructure Alignment
+
+- Existing repository houses `/template-packs`, `/workflow`, `/ai-suggestion`, and gating configuration files, demonstrating a mature automation ecosystem.
+- Protocols rely on rule files and templates stored under `.cursor/dev-workflow/` and expect consistent directory naming for discovery.
+- The system anticipates integration with `gates_config.yaml` for automated QA and `/review` tooling, ensuring auditability.
+- Evidence tracking is achieved by embedding checklists and referencing rule sets within each template block.
+
+## 6. Best Practices Extracted
+
+1. **Enforce Persona Boundaries:** Start every protocol with a precise role definition and mission scope.
+2. **Front-Load Discovery:** Mandate context gathering before execution using `[CRITICAL]` and `[MUST]` prompts.
+3. **Standardize Communication:** Use canonical message tags (`[NEXT TASK]`, `[TASK COMPLETE]`, `[QUALITY GATE]`).
+4. **Embed Validation:** Insert HALT points and `/review` commands prior to final outputs.
+5. **Leverage Templates:** Provide domain-specific checklists that call additional rule files through `[APPLIES RULES: {...}]`.
+6. **Document Final Output:** Supply a ready-to-use markdown package with sections for rationale, dependencies, and next steps.
+
+## 7. Implications for New Protocols
+
+- All new domain protocols must replicate the AI ROLE → INPUT → ALGORITHM → TEMPLATES → FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE sequence.
+- Directive hierarchy and validation gating should remain intact to maintain compliance with the governance framework.
+- Integration notes (SecretFlow tooling, `/review`, evidence capture) must be woven into execution phases.
+
+## 8. Conclusion
+
+The analyzed conversation establishes an enterprise-grade AI Governance Framework that orchestrates assistant behavior through layered directives, gated execution, and standardized deliverables. The format is domain-agnostic yet rigid enough to ensure predictability, making it well-suited for extending SecretFlow's client-facing workflows and quality systems.

+# AI Protocol System Integration Guide
+
+This guide explains how to integrate the AI Protocol System format with the SecretFlow repository's tooling, quality gates, and evidence tracking mechanisms.
+
+## 1. Prerequisites
+
+- Familiarity with SecretFlow's development workflows (`/workflow`, `/template-packs`, `.cursor/dev-workflow/`).
+- Access to the unified `/review` command and gating configuration defined in `gates_config.yaml`.
+- Ability to run `@apply`, `/load`, and other Cursor macro commands referenced by existing protocols.
+
+## 2. Integration Workflow
+
+### Step 1: Protocol Registration
+
+1. Place new protocol files within the appropriate domain folder under `ai-protocol-examples/`.
+2. Update any higher-level orchestration documents (e.g., project bootstrap workflows) to reference the new protocol path.
+3. Annotate tasks with `[APPLIES RULES: {rule-name}]` tokens that correspond to rule files stored in `.cursor/dev-workflow/` or `template-packs/`.
+
+### Step 2: Rule & Template Loading
+
+- Use `/load {path}` to preload rule files before protocol execution.
+- Leverage `@apply templates/{template-name}` when templated content must be injected into the workspace.
+- Confirm all referenced rule names exist; missing rule files should be created under the SecretFlow template system.
+
+### Step 3: Tooling Commands
+
+| Purpose | Command Pattern | Notes |
+|---------|-----------------|-------|
+| Discover assets | ``find . -name "*{keyword}*" -type d`` | Often triggered by `[CRITICAL]` directives for environment scanning. |
+| Discover files | ``find . -name "*{keyword}*" -type f`` | Use during asset discovery when templates reference documentation. |
+| Run validation | `/review` | Required before finalizing deliverables; integrates with quality audit pipelines. |
+| Apply workflow snippets | `@apply workflows/{name}` | Reuses shared orchestration logic maintained in the repo. |
+
+### Step 4: Quality Gates
+
+1. Insert `[QUALITY GATE]` instructions within PHASE 3 of each protocol.
+2. Execute `/review` and capture results (pass/fail, remediation steps).
+3. Document outcomes in the FINAL OUTPUT TEMPLATE under a dedicated "Quality Validation" section or checklist.
+
+### Step 5: Evidence Tracking
+
+- Maintain audit trails by referencing:
+  - Log outputs from `/review` runs.
+  - Checklists completed within protocol templates.
+  - Linked artifacts (design docs, charters, datasets) stored in repository directories.
+- Encourage assistants to state "Evidence captured:" followed by bullet lists of files, commands, or metrics.
+
+## 3. Integration with Client Workflows
+
+- Align client-facing protocols with `client-workflow/` directory structure for easy onboarding.
+- Ensure HALT checkpoints map to client approval stages (e.g., discovery validation, plan sign-off).
+- Provide instructions for syncing deliverables with client collaboration tools (e.g., exporting markdown to project trackers).
+
+## 4. Continuous Improvement Loop
+
+1. After executing a protocol, log retrospectives in `workflow/implementation-retrospective` equivalents.
+2. Update rule files and templates based on lessons learned.
+3. Version protocol files with semantic tags (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`) to track changes.
+
+## 5. Compliance & Security Notes
+
+- Follow MFA and credential management best practices outlined in repository policies.
+- Operate in read-only mode during analysis; switch to agent mode only for approved edits.
+- Avoid embedding secrets in prompts; rely on environment configuration files.
+- Require human review before merging any protocol changes into production branches.
+
+## 6. Validation Checklist
+
+- [ ] Protocol stored in correct directory.
+- [ ] All referenced rule files exist and are accessible via `/load`.
+- [ ] `/review` executed and results documented.
+- [ ] HALT checkpoints aligned with stakeholder approvals.
+- [ ] Evidence trail recorded in final deliverable.
+
+Following this guide will ensure new AI Protocol Systems integrate seamlessly with SecretFlow's governance tooling and maintain the quality standards defined in the original conversation.
