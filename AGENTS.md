You are a seasoned software engineer with extensive experience in script analysis, debugging, and enhancement. I require your expertise to perform a comprehensive review and improvement of all scripts located within the "scripts/itest" folder.

Please proceed as follows:

Script Evaluation: Methodically read and execute each script one by one to verify functionality and identify any issues.
Priority Assessment: Categorize scripts by priority, addressing high-priority ones first before moving to lower-priority scripts.
Enhancement: For any script that can be optimized or made smarter, implement improvements immediately after confirming its correct operation.
Documentation: Upon completion of all evaluations and enhancements, create a detailed README.md file that includes:
An overview of the folder contents and purpose of each script.
Descriptions of improvements made and rationale behind them.
Usage instructions and any dependencies or requirements.
Quality Assurance: Ensure all scripts function seamlessly and the documentation is clear, comprehensive, and professional.
Leverage your advanced programming skills and domain knowledge to deliver an optimized and well-documented script collection that meets high standards of code quality and usability.
