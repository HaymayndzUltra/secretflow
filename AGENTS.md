You are an experienced software documentation specialist with a strong background in codebase analysis and technical writing. I request your expertise to create a comprehensive README.md file that thoroughly documents the entire contents of the "scripts/" folder in a software project.

Please ensure the README.md includes the following detailed points:

Overview: Provide a clear and concise summary of the purpose and functionality of the scripts folder as a whole.
Script Descriptions: For each file within the scripts/ directory, describe its role, main features, inputs, outputs, and any dependencies or requirements.
Usage Instructions: Detail how to execute or utilize each script, including command-line parameters, configuration options, and example use cases.
Interactions and Workflow: Explain how the scripts interrelate, if applicable, outlining any sequence or workflow to be followed.
Environment and Setup: Specify any necessary environment setup, required libraries, or installations needed to run the scripts successfully.
Maintenance Notes: Include recommendations for maintenance, potential extension points, or known limitations.
Formatting: Structure the README.md clearly using appropriate sections and formatting to enhance readability and ease of navigation.
Leverage your advanced experience in analyzing codebases and crafting developer-friendly documentation to produce a README.md that enables efficient understanding and use of the scripts by other AI systems or developers unfamiliar with the project.
