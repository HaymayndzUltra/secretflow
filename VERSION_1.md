Summary
The AI Governor Framework embeds governance rules and lifecycle protocols directly in-repo to supply assistants with curated context, turning them into governed engineering partners that follow standardized bootstrap, PRD, planning, and implementation rituals.

Rule governance applies a three-layer hierarchy (master, common, project rules) so assistants can safely escalate from universal constraints to stack-specific knowledge while expanding the rule base through guided bootstrap steps.

Operational automation scripts span project generation, planning, compliance validation, gating, evidence capture, and deployment, prioritized so workflows like coverage enforcement, plan synthesis, and submission packaging can be orchestrated programmatically.

The project generator parses briefs, validates stack/compliance fit, and assembles full repos from template packs that cover frontend, backend, database, DevEx, CI/CD, and policy scaffolds while enforcing no-dependency constraints in source templates.

Workflow blueprints and phase playbooks encode evidence schemas and phase-specific assets (design packs, quality gates, launch runbooks, operations monitors) so automation can log deliverables through phases 0–6 with auditable manifests.

Unified Cursor prompts expose a /review orchestrator with interactive protocol selection and automated fallback across code, security, architecture, design, and UX checks for seamless AI-led audits in multiple tools.

Proposed End-to-End AI-Driven Approach
Leverage the existing governance-first ecosystem by chaining the .cursor/dev-workflow protocols with the automation catalog: start with bootstrap to populate rule contexts, route project briefs through generator and planning CLIs, execute implementation via parent-task chat loops, and invoke the unified /review orchestrator plus workflow scripts to enforce quality, compliance, and evidence logging at each gate. Human participation is limited to explicit approvals after each gated artifact (PRD, plan, scaffold, reviews, releases), maintaining oversight while AI completes hands-on work.

Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan
Phase 0 – Governance Bootstrap
Objective: Prepare AI with project-specific rules and context.
AI Actions: Run the bootstrap protocol to scan the repo, generate context kits, and confirm rule layers align with master/common/project taxonomy.
Outputs: Updated project rules, context READMEs, bootstrap log.
Human Validation: Confirm rule coverage matches architectural intent (e.g., core layers populated) before continuing.

Phase 1 – Discovery & PRD
Objective: Capture client needs into an approved PRD package.
AI Actions: Execute the PRD protocol to interview inputs, synthesize PRD drafts, and use high-priority scripts (e.g., generate_prd_assets.py) to structure compliance evidence.
Outputs: PRD markdown, supporting evidence bundle, validation report.
Human Validation: Review PRD for requirement fidelity and approve or request revisions before planning begins.

Phase 2 – Technical Planning & Architecture
Objective: Produce implementation plan, architecture artifacts, and contracts.
AI Actions: Run task-generation protocol, trigger planning scripts (plan_from_brief.py, architecture pack generators), and populate workflow phase-2 evidence (ADR, C4, OpenAPI per templates).
Outputs: PLAN.md, tasks.json, architecture bundle, contract lint logs.
Human Validation: Ensure plan sequencing, design decisions, and contracts satisfy scope; approve to unlock scaffolding.

Phase 3 – Environment & Scaffold Generation
Objective: Create working codebase aligned with chosen stacks.
AI Actions: Invoke project generator to validate stack compatibility and copy template packs, wiring DevEx/CI assets while respecting template constraints (no dependency installs in source packs).
Outputs: Generated repository, initial CI/workflow configs, context report.
Human Validation: Spot-check scaffold layout, dependencies, and CI readiness before implementation proceeds.

Phase 4 – Implementation & Quality Gates
Objective: Deliver features task-by-task with continuous audits.
AI Actions: Follow parent-task execution protocol, apply /review orchestrator for mode-specific checks, and run gating scripts (coverage, security, evidence) per task completion.
Outputs: Code changes, gate reports, retrospective notes, updated manifests.
Human Validation: Approve each parent-task bundle after reviewing audit summaries and evidence before merging.

Phase 5 – Integration & System Validation
Objective: Prove system readiness in integrated environments.
AI Actions: Generate observability packs, run quality rails and staging smoke scripts, and update evidence manifests per workflow schema.
Outputs: Observability specs, SLO docs, staging run logs, manifest updates.
Human Validation: Confirm integration checks meet acceptance thresholds and evidence completeness before launch prep.

Phase 6 – Launch & Submission Packaging
Objective: Execute release runbooks and compile client deliverables.
AI Actions: Use launch-phase scripts for rehearsal, deployment, and DR verification, then assemble submission packs with workflow templates and checklists.
Outputs: Deployment logs, rollback rehearsals, submission bundle (manifest, checklist).
Human Validation: Sign off on deployment readiness, review submission package, and authorize production release.

Phase 7 – Operations & Continuous Governance
Objective: Sustain system health post-launch.
AI Actions: Run operations scripts for SLO monitoring, retro scheduling, dependency/security updates, and maintain evidence logs for Phase 6 compliance.
Outputs: Monitoring reports, maintenance logs, retrospective schedules.
Human Validation: Review SLO dashboards and update priorities for future automation cycles.
