## Risk Mitigation Updates

### Addressed Risks
1. **Dependency Inversions**: Fixed by reordering weeks
2. **Late Testing**: Added validation gates between each week
3. **Packaging Issues**: Addressed in Week 1 foundation work
4. **Template Divergence**: Unified registry in Week 1
5. **Evidence Schema Conflicts**: Converter in Week 1

### Remaining Risks
1. **Timeline Extension**: 7 weeks vs original 5 weeks
   - *Mitigation*: Communicate early, show value of proper sequencing
2. **Resource Availability**: More developer time needed
   - *Mitigation*: Can parallelize some tasks across team
3. **Legacy System Downtime**: During cutover
   - *Mitigation*: CLI compatibility layer enables gradual migration

## Success Metrics

### Per-Week Metrics
- Week 1: Infrastructure ready, 0 sys.path hacks remain
- Week 2: Core modules integrated, 100% test pass rate
- Week 3: Templates unified, CLI telemetry active
- Week 4: All automation preserved, evidence compatible
- Week 5: External services connected, reviews automated
- Week 6: 80% test coverage, performance validated
- Week 7: 100% documentation, successful deployment

### Overall Success Criteria
- [ ] No runtime import failures
- [ ] All 40+ scripts integrated or wrapped
- [ ] Single template registry (no divergence)
- [ ] Evidence format unified
- [ ] All workflow1 automation preserved
- [ ] Performance equal or better
- [ ] Zero production incidents in first week

## Recommendation

**APPROVE 7-WEEK REVISED TIMELINE**

The additional 2 weeks are necessary to:
1. Fix foundational issues before building on them
2. Properly sequence dependencies
3. Add validation gates to catch issues early
4. Include documentation and training
5. Ensure safe production deployment

Attempting the original 5-week timeline would result in:
- Runtime failures from import issues
- Template discovery problems
- Lost automation from workflow1
- Late discovery of integration bugs
- Rushed deployment without proper validation

The revised timeline delivers a robust, properly integrated system with minimal production risk.
