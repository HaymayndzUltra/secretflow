## PROJECT EXECUTION ORCHESTRATION ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: Launch Control
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Go-Live Readiness Check:** Verify prerequisites, approvals, and gating conditions.
   - **1.1. `/load` Sprint Commitments:** Import current sprint objectives and team capacity.
   - **1.2. Risk Heatmap:** Update probability vs. impact matrix and mitigation owners.
2. **`[MUST]` Dependency Mapping:** Confirm cross-team deliverables, integration timelines, and testing availability.
3. **`[STRICT]` Change Control Activation:** Ensure change approval board cadence is scheduled with escalation paths.

### PHASE 2: Execution Oversight
1. **Cadence Enforcement:** Run standups, weekly steering reviews, and mid-sprint check-ins.
2. **Quality Alignment:** Trigger audits using `@apply .cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/code-review.md --mode comprehensi
ve` before major merges.
3. **Stakeholder Reporting:** Produce weekly status updates with scope, schedule, risk, and budget summaries.

### PHASE 3: Stabilization & Transition
1. **Operational Acceptance:** Validate monitoring, runbooks, and support handover readiness.
2. **Benefits Realization:** Track KPI progress and confirm client acknowledgement of value delivery.
