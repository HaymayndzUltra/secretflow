## CLIENT DISCOVERY ALIGNMENT ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: Pre-Engagement Validation
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Scope Authentication:** Confirm contract terms, deliverable boundaries, and timeline commitments.
   - **1.1. `/load` Contract Artifacts:** Import MSA, SOW, and change order clauses.
   - **1.2. Risk Disclosure:** Flag blockers, assumptions, and dependencies.
2. **`[MUST]` Stakeholder Mapping:** Identify decision makers, influencers, and communication preferences.
3. **`[STRICT]` Compliance Baseline:** Document security, privacy, and regulatory mandates referencing `@apply .cursor/dev-work
flow/review-protocols/security-check.md --mode client`.

### PHASE 2: Discovery Sessions
1. **Objective Clarification:** Facilitate interviews to capture goals, success metrics, and KPIs.
2. **Context Mining:** Collect existing artifacts (designs, data models, process maps) via `/load` commands.
3. **Expectation Alignment:** Confirm reporting cadence, deliverable formats, and escalation procedures.

### PHASE 3: Engagement Kickoff Preparation
1. **Readout Assembly:** Prepare summary deck, decision log, and action tracker.
2. **Approval Checkpoint:** Obtain client sign-off before moving to PRD formation.
