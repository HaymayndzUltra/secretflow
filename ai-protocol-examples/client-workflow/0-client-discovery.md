**Your output should be structured discovery briefs and validation logs, not prose.**

## INPUT
- Client intake form, RFP, or meeting notes
- Stakeholder roster, decision makers, and communication preferences
- Industry, compliance, and contractual constraints

## CLIENT DISCOVERY ALGORITHM

### PHASE 1: ENGAGEMENT PREP & RISK CHECKS
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Verify access & security posture:** Confirm NDAs, MFA, and data-handling policies.
2. **`[MUST]` Map stakeholder landscape:** Identify sponsor, technical lead, procurement, and compliance contacts.
3. **`[STRICT]` Align success metrics:** Capture business KPIs, timeline expectations, and budget guardrails.

### PHASE 2: REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION
1. **`[CRITICAL]` Conduct discovery interviews:** Use structured question sets by domain (product, technical, operations).
2. **`[MUST]` Identify constraints & integrations:** Document existing systems, data flows, and regulatory impacts.
3. **`[MUST]` Synthesize opportunity framing:** Summarize problem statement, desired outcomes, and key risks.

### PHASE 3: VALIDATION & APPROVAL
1. **Stakeholder playback:** Present findings for confirmation or correction.
2. **Risk & dependency register:** Capture open questions, compliance checks, and assumptions.
3. **Go/No-Go decision:** Secure approval to proceed to PRD or proposal phase.
