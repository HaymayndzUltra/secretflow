# Client Workflow Infrastructure Analysis

## Scope and Objectives

- Evaluate existing automation and workflow assets to determine reusability for client engagements.
- Identify integration points, supporting systems, and coverage gaps for professional client project delivery.
- Establish a foundation for client-focused workflow protocols that remain compatible with SecretFlow's AI Governor ecosystem.

## Directory Findings

### `scripts/`

- Contains automation CLIs for lifecycle orchestration, including workflow execution (`run_workflow.py`), validation (`validate_workflows.py`, `validate_tasks.py`), and project generation utilities tailored for client scenarios (`generate_client_project.py`, `generate_prd_assets.py`).
- Offers compliance tooling (e.g., `validate_compliance_assets.py`, `check_hipaa.py`) and reporting helpers (`evidence_report.py`, `write_context_report.py`) that can underpin client audit and sign-off processes.
- Provides rollback, deployment, and plan automation (`rollback_frontend.sh`, `trigger_plan.py`, `plan_from_brief.py`) supporting change management and release readiness.

### `project_generator/`

- Core engine (`core/generator.py`, `core/validator.py`) produces configurable project scaffolds with industry-aware defaults (`core/industry_config.py`).
- Template registry (`templates/registry.py`) and template packs (`template-packs/`) supply stack-specific assets that can be reused to bootstrap client deliverables quickly.
- Integration hooks (`integrations/`) allow alignment with deployment platforms and compliance requirements, enabling consistent outputs for diverse client profiles.

### `workflow/` & `workflow/templates/`

- Houses canonical workflow manifests (`workflow_backend.yaml`, `workflow_fullstack.yaml`) and submission templates (`submission_checklist.md`, `evidence_schema.json`).
- Provides structure for quality gates and deliverable tracking that can be extended to incorporate client approval checkpoints and evidence capture.

### `.github/`

- CI/CD workflows enforce linting, testing, deployment promotions, and secret scanning—key for maintaining quality standards across client projects.
- Pull request templates encapsulate review expectations and can be augmented with client-facing verification steps (e.g., stakeholder approvals, compliance sign-offs).

### `.cursor/dev-workflow/review-protocols/`

- Contains reusable review protocols (architecture, security, accessibility, etc.) aligned with AI Governor quality layers.
- Protocol structure (mission, layered audits, report formats) can be referenced from client workflows to ensure consistent validation, evidence logging, and reviewer alignment.

### `workflow1/`

- Provides expanded phase playbooks (Phase 0–6) with evidence directories and automation references tailored for large engagements.
- Includes execution templates (`PROJECT_EXECUTION_TEMPLATE.md`) and specialty phase guides (e.g., `codex-phase3-quality-rails`) that can be adapted to client-specific lifecycle checkpoints.

## Reusable Capabilities for Client Work

- **Automation CLI foundation:** `scripts/run_workflow.py`, `trigger_plan.py`, and validation scripts deliver orchestrated automation that can be mapped to client lifecycle triggers.
- **Industry-aware scaffolding:** `project_generator` already supports client-centric generation with compliance and stack presets, ideal for discovery and scoping phases.
- **Evidence & compliance frameworks:** Workflow templates and review protocols provide traceability artifacts that can be extended for client audits and progress reports.
- **CI/CD governance:** `.github` workflows enforce consistent quality gates that can be leveraged for client deliverables and release approvals.

## Identified Gaps

- **Client communication tracking:** No existing templates capture stakeholder communications, decision logs, or approval chains.
- **Progress reporting cadence:** Need structured checkpoints aligned with client updates (weekly summaries, milestone sign-offs) beyond internal quality gates.
- **Resource estimation linkage:** Current task generation focuses on engineering outputs without integrating budget/time estimations and client expectations.
- **Change management approvals:** Lack of explicit workflows for scope change requests, impact analysis, and client authorization steps.
- **Relationship management:** No post-project handoff or satisfaction tracking mechanisms for ongoing client engagement.

## Integration Opportunities

- **Protocol embedding:** New client workflow files can reference review protocols via `[APPLIES RULES: ...]`, ensuring audits reuse established quality layers.
- **Automation hooks:** Scripts such as `generate_client_project.py` and `plan_from_brief.py` can be linked in discovery and planning phases to accelerate deliverable creation.
- **Evidence schema alignment:** Client checkpoints should output artifacts that conform to `workflow/templates/evidence_schema.json` for compatibility with existing reporting tools.
- **CI touchpoints:** Integrate `.github/workflows` checks (lint/test/deploy) as mandatory gates before client demos or releases.
- **Workflow1 synergy:** Adopt phase sequencing and evidence directories to maintain traceability while introducing client-specific checkpoints and communications.

## Next Steps

1. Design client workflow protocols mirroring existing dev-workflow structure while embedding client communication, approval, and reporting steps.
2. Link each phase to reusable automation scripts, review protocols, and evidence requirements identified above.
3. Define new templates for client deliverables (status updates, approval records) that align with the AI Governor template and evidence systems.
4. Document integration guidance to ensure practitioners understand how to pair client workflows with existing SecretFlow automation and CI/CD pipelines.
