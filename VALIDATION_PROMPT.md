# AI Validation Prompt: Integration Plan Review

## Context
I have created a comprehensive integration plan to merge multiple development workflow systems into a unified solution. I need you to validate this plan for completeness, correctness, and potential issues before implementation.

## Your Role
You are a **Senior Software Architecture Reviewer** with expertise in:
- System integration patterns
- Workflow orchestration
- Dependency management
- Risk assessment
- Implementation planning

## Task
Review the integration plan and provide detailed feedback on:
1. **Completeness**: Are all components covered?
2. **Correctness**: Are the integration points accurate?
3. **Gaps**: What's missing or unclear?
4. **Risks**: What could go wrong?
5. **Sequencing**: Is the order logical?
6. **Dependencies**: Are all dependencies mapped?

### Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Integration (Priority 1)
1. **Project Generator Integration**
   - Target: `unified-workflow/automation/project_generator.py`
   - Dependencies: `ProjectGenerator`, `ProjectValidator`, `IndustryConfig`, `TemplateRegistry`, `BriefParser`
   - Integration Points: Project structure generation, template application, industry configs, compliance validation

2. **Brief Processing Integration**
   - Target: `unified-workflow/automation/brief_processor.py`
   - Dependencies: `BriefParser`, `lifecycle_tasks`, `plan_from_brief`

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Week 1**: Core Infrastructure Integration
2. **Week 2**: Phase Protocol Enhancement
3. **Week 3**: Template Packs Integration
4. **Week 4**: AI Orchestrator Update
5. **Week 5**: Testing & Validation

### Identified Duplicate Logic
1. **Evidence Management**: `unified-workflow/automation/evidence_manager.py` vs `scripts/workflow_automation/evidence.py`
2. **Quality Gates**: `unified-workflow/automation/quality_gates.py` vs `scripts/enforce_gates.py`
3. **Validation Logic**: `unified-workflow/automation/validation_gates.py` vs `scripts/validate_*.py`
4. **Orchestration**: `unified-workflow/automation/ai_orchestrator.py` vs `scripts/run_workflow.py`

### Risk Mitigation
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Use virtual environments and dependency resolution
- **Artifact Conflicts**: Standardize formats and create conversion utilities
- **CLI Conflicts**: Create unified CLI interface and deprecate old commands

## Additional Context

The goal is to create a unified developer workflow that:
- Integrates all existing automation scripts
- Provides a single entry point for developers
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Eliminates duplicate logic
- Ensures proper artifact generation
- Maintains quality and compliance standards

The integration should result in a production-ready system that can be deployed and used by development teams immediately.
