3. **Implement** the alignment fixes according to your chosen approach
4. **Ensure** the framework is production-ready and usable by any AI

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Generator and Execution rulebooks are properly aligned
- Evidence paths are consistent between both files
- Success criteria and validation protocols are complete
- Framework can be used by any AI with minimal human guidance
- No missing steps in the development lifecycle

## FILES TO MODIFY
